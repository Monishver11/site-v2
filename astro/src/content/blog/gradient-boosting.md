In our previous post, we explored how **Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling (FSAM)** with exponential loss recovers the AdaBoost algorithm. But FSAM is not limited to exponential loss — it can be extended to **any differentiable loss**, leading to the powerful and flexible framework of **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**.

This post walks through the derivation of gradient boosting, starting with the squared loss, and builds toward a general functional gradient descent interpretation of boosting.

## **FSAM with Squared Loss**

Let’s begin with FSAM using squared loss. At the $m$-th boosting round, we wish to find a new function $v h(x)$ to add to the model $f_{m-1}(x)$. The objective becomes:

$$
J(v, h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i - \underbrace{[f_{m-1}(x_i) + v h(x_i)]}_{\text{new model}} \right)^2
$$

If the hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ is closed under rescaling (i.e., if $h \in \mathcal{H}$ implies $v h \in \mathcal{H}$ for all $v \in \mathbb{R}$), we can drop $v$ and simplify the objective:

$$
J(h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \underbrace{[y_i - f_{m-1}(x_i)]}_{\text{residual}} - h(x_i) \right)^2
$$

This is just **least squares regression on the residuals** — fit $h(x)$ to approximate the residuals $[y_i - f_{m-1}(x_i)]$.

## **Interpreting the Residuals**

Let’s take a closer look at how **residuals relate to gradients** in the context of boosting with squared loss.

The objective for squared loss is:

$$
J(f) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - f(x_i))^2
$$

This measures how far the model predictions $f(x_i)$ are from the true labels $y_i$ across the dataset.

To minimize this objective, we can perform gradient descent. So we ask: **what is the gradient of $J(f)$ with respect to $f(x_i)$?**

Let’s compute it:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial f(x_i)} J(f) = \frac{\partial}{\partial f(x_i)} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n (y_j - f(x_j))^2 \right]
$$

Because only the $i$-th term depends on $f(x_i)$, this simplifies to:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial f(x_i)} J(f) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot (-2)(y_i - f(x_i)) = -\frac{2}{n}(y_i - f(x_i))
$$

The term $y_i - f(x_i)$ is the **residual** at point $x_i$. So we see:

> The residual is proportional to the **negative gradient** of the squared loss.

**Why This Matters for Boosting**

Gradient descent updates a parameter in the opposite direction of the gradient. Similarly, in **gradient boosting**, we update our model $f$ in the direction of a function that tries to approximate the **negative gradient** at every data point.

In the case of squared loss, this just means:

- Compute the residuals $r_i = y_i - f(x_i)$.
- Fit a new base learner $h_m$ to those residuals.
- Add $h_m$ to the model: $f \leftarrow f + v h_m$.

This process mimics the behavior of **gradient descent in function space**.

We can now draw an analogy:

- **Boosting update:**  $f \leftarrow f + \textcolor{red}{v} \textcolor{green}{h}$
- **Gradient descent:** $f \leftarrow f - \textcolor{red}{\alpha} \textcolor{green}{\nabla_f J(f)}$
  
**Note: Observe the variables highlighted in red and green.**

Where:
- $h$ approximates the direction of steepest descent (the gradient),
- $v$ is the step size (akin to learning rate $\alpha$),
- and the update improves the model's predictions to reduce the loss.

This perspective generalizes easily to other loss functions, which we explore in the next sections on **functional gradient descent**.

## **Functional Gradient Descent: Intuition and Setup**

To generalize FSAM to arbitrary (differentiable) loss functions, we adopt the **functional gradient descent** perspective.

Suppose we have a loss function that depends on predictions $f(x_i)$ at $n$ training examples:

$$
J(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f(x_i))
$$

Note that $f$ is a function, but this loss only depends on $f$ through its values on the training points. So, we can treat:

$$
f = (f(x_1), f(x_2), \dots, f(x_n))^\top
$$

as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and write:

$$
J(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f_i)
$$

where $f_i := f(x_i)$. We want to minimize $J(f)$ by updating our predictions $f_i$ in the **steepest descent direction**.


## **Unconstrained Step Direction (Pseudo-Residuals)**

We compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each prediction:

$$
g = \nabla_f J(f) = \left( \frac{\partial \ell(y_1, f_1)}{\partial f_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial \ell(y_n, f_n)}{\partial f_n} \right)
$$

The **negative gradient direction** is:

$$
-g = -\nabla_f J(f) = \left( -\frac{\partial \ell(y_1, f_1)}{\partial f_1}, \dots, -\frac{\partial \ell(y_n, f_n)}{\partial f_n} \right)
$$

This tells us how to change each $f(x_i)$ to decrease the loss — it's the direction of steepest descent in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

We call this vector the **pseudo-residuals**. In the case of squared loss:

$$
\ell(y_i, f_i) = (y_i - f_i)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -g_i = y_i - f_i
$$

So, pseudo-residuals coincide with actual residuals for squared loss.


## **Projection Step: Fitting the Pseudo-Residuals**

We now want to update the function $f$ by stepping in direction $-g$. However, we can’t directly take a step in $\mathbb{R}^n$ — we must stay within our base hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$.

So we find the **function $h \in \mathcal{H}$** that best fits the negative gradient at the training points. This is a projection of $-g$ onto the function class:

$$
h = \arg\min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( -g_i - h(x_i) \right)^2
$$

This is just **least squares regression** of pseudo-residuals.

Once we have $h$, we take a step:

$$
f \leftarrow f + v h
$$

where $v$ is a step size, which can either be fixed (e.g., shrinkage factor $\lambda$) or found via line search.


**All Together;**

- **Objective**:
  $$
  J(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f(x_i))
  $$

- **Unconstrained gradient**:
  $$
  g = \nabla_f J(f) = \left( \frac{\partial \ell(y_1, f_1)}{\partial f_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial \ell(y_n, f_n)}{\partial f_n} \right)
  \tag{25}
  $$

- **Projection**:
  $$
  h = \arg\min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \sum_{i=1}^n (-g_i - h(x_i))^2
  \tag{26}
  $$

- **Boosting update**:
  $$
  f \leftarrow f + v h
  $$

This gives a general recipe for boosting: **approximate the negative gradient with a weak learner and take a small step in that direction** — hence the name **gradient boosting**.


## **Functional Gradient Descent: Hyperparameters and Regularization**

Once we have our base learner $h_m$ for iteration $m$, we need to decide how far to move in that direction.

We can either:

- **Choose a step size $v_m$ by line search**:
  $$
  v_m = \arg\min_v \sum_{i=1}^n \ell\left(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + v h_m(x_i)\right)
  $$

- **Or** use a fixed step size $v$ as a hyperparameter. Line search is not strictly necessary but can improve performance.

To **regularize** and control overfitting, we scale the step size with a **shrinkage factor** $\lambda \in (0, 1]$:

$$
f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \lambda v_m h_m(x)
$$

This shrinkage slows down learning and typically improves generalization. A common choice is $\lambda = 0.1$.

We also need to decide:

- The **number of steps $M$** (i.e., number of boosting rounds).
  - This is typically chosen via early stopping or tuning on a validation set.

## **Gradient Boosting Algorithm**

Putting everything together, the gradient boosting algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialize the model** with a constant function:
   $$
   f_0(x) = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, \gamma)
   $$

2. **For** $m = 1$ to $M$:

   1. **Compute the pseudo-residuals** (i.e., the negative gradients):

      $$
      r_{im} = -\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial f(x_i)} \ell(y_i, f(x_i)) \right]_{f(x_i) = f_{m-1}(x_i)}
      $$

   2. **Fit a base learner** $h_m$ (e.g., regression tree) to the dataset $\{(x_i, r_{im})\}_{i=1}^n$ using squared error.

   3. *(Optional)* **Line search** to find best step size:
      $$
      v_m = \arg\min_v \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + v h_m(x_i))
      $$

   4. **Update the model**:
      $$
      f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \lambda v_m h_m(x)
      $$

3. **Return** the final model: $f_M(x)$

## **Conclusion: The Gradient Boosting Machine Ingredients**

To implement gradient boosting, you need:

- A loss function $\ell(y, f(x))$ that is differentiable w.r.t. $f(x)$
- A base hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ (e.g., decision trees) for regression
- A method to choose step size: fixed, or via line search
- A stopping criterion: number of iterations $M$, or early stopping
- Regularization through **shrinkage** ($\lambda$)

Once these ingredients are in place, you're ready to build powerful models with **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**!

In the next post, we’ll explore specific loss functions like **logistic loss** for classification and how gradient boosting works in this setting. 

Take care!
