In the previous post, we saw how learning both the weights and basis functions gives rise to adaptive models — and how neural networks and decision trees fit into this framework. Now, we dive into **Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling (FSAM)**, a greedy algorithm that forms the foundation of **Gradient Boosting**.

---

## **What is FSAM?**

Our goal is to fit a model of the form:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M v_m h_m(x)
$$

where each $h_m \in \mathcal{H}$ is a basis function, and $v_m$ is its weight. The key idea is to **greedily** fit one function at a time without changing previously fitted ones. That’s why it’s called **forward stagewise**.

After $m - 1$ steps, we have:

$$
f_{m-1}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} v_i h_i(x)
$$

At step $m$, we select a new basis function $h_m \in \mathcal{H}$ and weight $v_m > 0$ to form:

$$
f_m(x) = \underbrace{ f_{m-1}(x) }_{\text{fixed}} + v_m h_m(x)
$$

We choose $(v_m, h_m)$ to minimize the loss as much as possible.

## **FSAM for Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)**

Let’s apply FSAM to an ERM objective. We proceed as follows:

1. **Initialize:**  
   
   $$ f_0(x) = 0 $$

2. **For** $m = 1$ to $M$:  
   - Compute:

     $$
     (v_m, h_m) = \arg\min_{v \in \mathbb{R}, h \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell\left(y_i, f_{m-1}(x_i) + v h(x_i)\right)
     $$

   - Update:

     $$
     f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + v_m h_m(x)
     $$

3. **Return** $f_M$

---

## **Exponential Loss**

Let’s use the **exponential loss**:

$$
\ell(y, f(x)) = \exp\left( -y f(x) \right)
$$

This loss function is margin-based, it penalizes examples based on how confidently they are classified.

## **FSAM with Exponential Loss**

Apply the FSAM steps using exponential loss:

1. **Initialize:**  
   
   $$ f_0(x) = 0 $$

2. **For** $m = 1$ to $M$:  
   - Compute:

     $$
     (v_m, h_m) = \arg\min_{v \in \mathbb{R}, h \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left(-y_i \left( f_{m-1}(x_i) + \overbrace{v h(x_i)}^{\text{new piece}} \right)\right)
     $$

   - Update:  
  
     $$ f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + v_m h_m(x) $$

3. **Return** $f_M$

## **FSAM with Exponential Loss: Basis Function**


We assume the base hypothesis space is:

$$
\mathcal{H} = \left\{ h : \mathcal{X} \to \{-1, 1\} \right\}
$$

At the $m^\text{th}$ round, our goal is to choose $v$ and $h$ to minimize the following objective:

$$
J(v, h) = \sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left[ -y_i \left( f_{m-1}(x_i) + v h(x_i) \right) \right]
$$

We define:

$$
w_i^m \triangleq \exp\left( -y_i f_{m-1}(x_i) \right)
$$

This lets us re-express the objective as:

$$
J(v, h) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \exp\left( -y_i v h(x_i) \right)
$$

Now, because $h(x_i) \in \{-1, 1\}$, we can split the expression into cases:

$$
J(v, h) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \left[ \mathbb{I}(y_i = h(x_i)) e^{-v} + \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i)) e^{v} \right]
$$

Recall that:

$$
\mathbb{I}(y_i = h(x_i)) = 1 - \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))
$$

Using this identity, we can further simplify:

$$
J(v, h) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \left[ (e^v - e^{-v}) \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i)) + e^{-v} \right]
$$


At this point, we're ready to decide how to pick the best $h$.


Note that the second term of the objective function, $e^{-v}$ is constant with respect to $h$, and if $v > 0$, the term $e^v - e^{-v}$ is positive. Therefore, minimizing $J(v, h)$ is equivalent to minimizing:

$$
\arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))
$$

This leads to:

$$
h_m = \arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))
$$

We can also write this as a weighted classification error:

$$
h_m = \arg \min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))
$$

In other words, $h_m$ is the classifier that minimizes the **weighted zero-one loss**.

---

## **FSAM with Exponential Loss: Classifier Weights**

Now that we’ve selected the best basis function $h_m$, let’s figure out how to choose the best weight $v_m$ for it.

We define the **weighted zero-one error** at round $m$ as:

$$
\text{err}_m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m}
$$

This error measures how poorly the current hypothesis $h$ is doing, taking into account the importance (weights) of each example.

Then, it can be shown that the optimal value for $v_m$ — the coefficient for the current basis function is:

$$
v_m = \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1 - \text{err}_m}{\text{err}_m}
\tag{14}
$$

This is exactly the same form as the weight update in AdaBoost (just scaled differently). Note that if $\text{err}_m < 0.5$ — that is, our current classifier is better than random guessing — then $v_m > 0$, meaning it contributes positively.

---

**Derivation of the expression for the optimal classifier weights**

To justify this expression for the optimal coefficient $v_m$, recall that our goal at each round is to minimize the exponential loss objective:

$$
J(v, h) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \left[ \exp(-v) \cdot \mathbb{I}(y_i = h(x_i)) + \exp(v) \cdot \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i)) \right]
$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$
J(v, h) = \exp(-v) \sum_{i: y_i = h(x_i)} w_i^m + \exp(v) \sum_{i: y_i \ne h(x_i)} w_i^m
$$

Define the **weighted error** of hypothesis $h$ as:

$$
\text{err}_m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h(x_i))}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^m}
$$

Let:

- $W^{+} = \sum_{i: y_i = h(x_i)} w_i^m$ (correctly classified)
- $W^{-} = \sum_{i: y_i \ne h(x_i)} w_i^m$ (misclassified)

So the objective becomes:

$$
J(v, h) = W^+ \exp(-v) + W^- \exp(v)
$$

To find the optimal $v = v_m$ for a fixed $h = h_m$, we differentiate with respect to $v$ and set to zero:

$$
\frac{dJ}{dv} = -W^+ \exp(-v) + W^- \exp(v) = 0
$$

Solving:

$$
W^- \exp(v) = W^+ \exp(-v) \\
\Rightarrow \frac{W^-}{W^+} = \exp(-2v) \\
\Rightarrow -2v = \log\left( \frac{W^-}{W^+} \right) \\
\Rightarrow v = \frac{1}{2} \log\left( \frac{W^+}{W^-} \right)
$$

Since:

$$
\text{err}_m = \frac{W^-}{W^- + W^+} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 - \text{err}_m = \frac{W^+}{W^- + W^+}
$$

We get:

$$
\frac{W^+}{W^-} = \frac{1 - \text{err}_m}{\text{err}_m}
$$

Therefore, the optimal weight for classifier $h_m$ is:

$$
v_m = \frac{1}{2} \log\left( \frac{1 - \text{err}_m}{\text{err}_m} \right)
\tag{14}
$$

This result balances the classifier's confidence based on how well it performs: higher confidence (larger $v_m$) when error is low, and lower confidence when error is close to 0.5.

---

## **FSAM with Exponential Loss: Updating Example Weights**

After choosing the best classifier $h_m$ and its corresponding weight $v_m$, we now update the example weights for the next round.

The weights at round $m+1$ are defined as:

$$
w_i^{m+1} \overset{\text{def}}{=} \exp\left( -y_i f_m(x_i) \right)
\tag{15}
$$

Recall that the updated model at round $m$ is:

$$
f_m(x_i) = f_{m-1}(x_i) + v_m h_m(x_i)
\tag{16}
$$

Substituting this into the definition of the new weights:

$$
w_i^{m+1} = \exp\left( -y_i (f_{m-1}(x_i) + v_m h_m(x_i)) \right) \\
= \exp\left( -y_i f_{m-1}(x_i) \right) \cdot \exp\left( -y_i v_m h_m(x_i) \right) \\
= w_i^m \cdot \exp\left( -y_i v_m h_m(x_i) \right)
\tag{17}
$$

This form shows how the current round’s prediction ($h_m(x_i)$) affects the weight of example $i$ moving forward.

Let’s interpret this based on classification correctness:

- If $y_i = h_m(x_i)$ (i.e., correctly classified), then:

  $$
  -y_i v_m h_m(x_i) = -v_m \cdot 1 = -v_m
  $$

- If $y_i \ne h_m(x_i)$ (i.e., misclassified), since both $y_i$ and $h_m(x_i)$ are in $\{-1, 1\}$:

  $$
  -y_i v_m h_m(x_i) = -v_m \cdot (-1) = +v_m
  $$

We can now re-express the update in terms of the indicator function:

$$
w_i^{m+1} = w_i^m \cdot \exp\left( 2v_m \mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h_m(x_i)) \right) \cdot \underbrace{\exp(-v_m)}_{\text{constant scaler}}
\tag{18}
$$

This is because:
- When $y_i = h_m(x_i)$, $\mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h_m(x_i)) = 0$, so the exponent is $0$ and we just get $w_i^m \cdot \exp(-v_m)$.
- When $y_i \ne h_m(x_i)$, $\mathbb{I}(y_i \ne h_m(x_i)) = 1$, so the exponent is $2v_m$, and the weight becomes $w_i^m \cdot \exp(v_m)$.

**Interpretation**

- **Correct classification**: the weight gets multiplied by $\exp(-v_m)$ → the example becomes **less important**.
- **Misclassification**: the weight gets multiplied by $\exp(v_m)$ → the example becomes **more important**.

This mechanism focuses the learner on harder examples in future rounds, by increasing their influence.

> The constant factor $\exp(-v_m)$ appears in all weights and **cancels out during normalization**. So only the relative importance matters.

**Connection to AdaBoost**

Observe that:

$$
2v_m = \alpha_m
$$

This matches the AdaBoost formulation, where $\alpha_m$ is the weight assigned to the classifier at round $m$.

Hence, **FSAM with exponential loss recovers AdaBoost’s update rule**, making it a principled derivation from a loss minimization perspective.

## **Why Use Exponential Loss?**

The exponential loss function is given by:

$$
\ell_{\text{exp}}(y, f(x)) = \exp(-y f(x))
$$

This loss has an elegant statistical interpretation. Specifically, it turns out that minimizing the expected exponential loss leads to a prediction function that estimates the **log-odds** of the label being positive:

$$
f^*(x) = \frac{1}{2} \log \left( \frac{p(y = 1 \mid x)}{p(y = -1 \mid x)} \right)
$$

This result aligns with the principle behind **logistic regression**, where the model estimates the log-odds of class membership. Here's how we can justify it:

**Derivation Sketch**

We seek the function $f^*(x)$ that minimizes the expected exponential loss:

$$
\mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y \mid x)}\left[ \exp(-y f(x)) \right]
= p(y = 1 \mid x) \exp(-f(x)) + p(y = -1 \mid x) \exp(f(x))
$$

Define:

- $p_+ = p(y = 1 \mid x)$
- $p_- = p(y = -1 \mid x) = 1 - p_+$

So, the expected loss becomes:

$$
L(f) = p_+ \exp(-f) + p_- \exp(f)
$$

Take the derivative w.r.t. $f$ and set to zero:

$$
\frac{dL}{df} = -p_+ \exp(-f) + p_- \exp(f) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow p_- \exp(f) = p_+ \exp(-f) \\
\Rightarrow \frac{p_-}{p_+} = \exp(-2f) \\
\Rightarrow f^*(x) = \frac{1}{2} \log \left( \frac{p_+}{p_-} \right)
$$

Thus,

$$
f^*(x) = \frac{1}{2} \log \left( \frac{p(y = 1 \mid x)}{p(y = -1 \mid x)} \right)
$$

**Interpretation**

The exponential loss encourages predictions that align with the **log-odds ratio**. This makes it a natural choice for binary classification problems where confidence is important, and it helps explain why AdaBoost, which minimizes exponential loss, is such a powerful classifier.

## **AdaBoost and Exponential Loss: Robustness Issues**

While exponential loss has nice theoretical and computational properties, it comes with a key drawback — **lack of robustness**.

Recall that the exponential loss is:

$$
\ell_{\text{exp}}(y, f(x)) = \exp(-y f(x))
$$
![gb-2](/img/gb-2.png)
This function grows **exponentially** as the margin $y f(x)$ becomes more negative. So:

- **Misclassified examples** (where $y f(x) < 0$) incur **very high penalties**.
- As a result, **outliers** or **noisy labels** can dominate the loss and heavily influence the model.

**Practical Consequences**

- AdaBoost (which minimizes exponential loss) tends to **over-focus on misclassified points**, even if they are noisy or mislabeled.
- This leads to **degraded performance** in datasets with:
  - High **Bayes error rate** (i.e., intrinsic label uncertainty),
  - Significant **label noise**.

In contrast, **logistic loss** (or log-loss), used in **Logistic Regression**, penalizes mistakes more **gradually** and is **more robust** in such settings.


**Why Still Use Exponential Loss?**

Despite these robustness concerns, exponential loss has some **computational advantages**:

- It leads to **simpler update rules** (as seen in AdaBoost),
- The math works out cleanly in boosting settings,
- It's easy to implement and analyze.

So in summary:

> **Exponential loss** is powerful and efficient but sensitive to outliers.  
> **Logistic loss** is more robust, especially when the data is noisy or inherently uncertain.

## **Wrapping up**

In this post, we’ve unpacked how **Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling (FSAM)** builds models by greedily adding base learners — and how, when paired with the **exponential loss**, it naturally recovers the well-known **AdaBoost** algorithm.

Key takeaways:

- FSAM provides a clean, iterative framework for model building.
- The **exponential loss** leads to a simple and elegant form of weight updates.
- AdaBoost emerges as a special case of FSAM with exponential loss, emphasizing misclassified examples via **weighted classification error** and **adaptive reweighting**.

However, this formulation is limited to specific loss functions like the exponential loss. 

**What’s next?**  
In the upcoming post, we’ll generalize this framework to work with **any differentiable loss function**, leading to the powerful and flexible family of models known as **Gradient Boosted Machines (GBMs)**.
