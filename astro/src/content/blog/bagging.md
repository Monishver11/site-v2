Previously, we saw how ensemble methods, like averaging independent models or using bootstrap sampling, can reduce variance and improve prediction stability.

Today, we dive deeper into one powerful technique: **Bagging** — Bootstrap Aggregating, and explore how it helps build more stable and accurate models.

## **Bagging: Bootstrap Aggregation**

Bagging, short for **Bootstrap Aggregation**, is a general-purpose method for reducing variance.

The idea is simple:

- Draw $B$ bootstrap samples $D_1, D_2, \dots, D_B$ from the original dataset $D$.
- Train a model on each bootstrap sample to get prediction functions:

  $$
  \hat{f}_1, \hat{f}_2, \dots, \hat{f}_B
  $$

- Combine their predictions. The bagged prediction function is:

  $$
  \hat{f}_{\text{avg}}(x) = \text{Combine}\left( \hat{f}_1(x), \hat{f}_2(x), \dots, \hat{f}_B(x) \right)
  $$

Depending on the task:
- For **regression**, we typically average predictions.
- For **classification**, we usually take a **majority vote**.

**Key Point: Why Bagging Doesn't Overfit**

One of the most powerful aspects of bagging is that **increasing the number of trees does not cause overfitting**.  
In fact, adding more trees generally **improves performance** by further reducing the variance of the model.  
Since each tree is trained on a slightly different bootstrap sample, their errors tend to average out, making the overall prediction more stable and reliable.  
Thus, more trees usually help — at worst, performance plateaus, but it rarely gets worse with additional trees.

**Downside: Loss of Interpretability**

However, this variance reduction comes at a cost. A **single decision tree** is often easy to visualize and interpret: you can follow a clear, logical path from the root to a prediction.  
With **hundreds or thousands of trees** combined in a bagged ensemble, the resulting model becomes a black box — it is much harder (or nearly impossible) to trace a single prediction back through all contributing trees. In other words, bagging sacrifices **interpretability** for **predictive performance**.

## **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Predictions and Error Estimation**

Bagging also provides a natural way to estimate test error without needing a separate validation set!

Recall:
- Each bagged model is trained on roughly **63%** of the original data.
- The remaining **37%** — the observations not included in the bootstrap sample — are called **out-of-bag (OOB) observations**.

For the $i$-th training point:

- Define the set of bootstrap samples **that did not include** $x_i$ as:

  $$
  S_i = \{b \,\vert\, D_b \text{ does not contain } x_i\}
  $$

- The **Out-of-Bag (OOB) prediction** for $x_i$ is then the average prediction across all trees where $x_i$ was not used in training:

  $$
  \hat{f}_{\text{OOB}}(x_i) = \frac{1}{|S_i|} \sum_{b \in S_i} \hat{f}_b(x_i)
  $$

Here, $\vert S_i \vert$ is the number of trees that did not see $x_i$ during training.

Once we have OOB predictions for all training points, we can compute the **OOB error** by comparing these predictions against the true labels.

The OOB error serves as a reliable estimate of the model’s test error — **similar to cross-validation**, but **without needing to split the data** or perform multiple rounds of training. This makes OOB evaluation very efficient, especially for large datasets.


## **Applying Bagging to Classification Trees**

Let’s look at a practical example:

- Input space: $X = \mathbb{R}^5$
- Output space: $Y = \{-1, 1\}$
- Sample size: $n = 30$

When we train decision trees on different bootstrap samples, the trees we get are often **very different** from one another.

- Each bootstrap sample is a slightly different version of the original dataset.
- As a result, the **splitting variables** chosen at the root (and deeper nodes) can change significantly across trees.
- This leads to trees with **different structures**, **different decision boundaries**, and ultimately, **different predictions**.

This behavior highlights a key property of decision trees: they are **high variance models**. Even small perturbations or changes in the training data can cause a decision tree to change substantially.

However, instead of seeing this as a disadvantage, we **leverage** this property through **bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregation). By training multiple high-variance trees on different bootstrap samples and **averaging** their predictions, we are able to:

- **Reduce variance** significantly
- **Stabilize predictions**
- **Improve overall model performance** without increasing bias

Thus, bagging turns the natural instability of decision trees into a **strength**, leading to a more robust and accurate ensemble model.

## **Why Decision Trees Are Ideal for Bagging**

Bagging is particularly powerful when the base models are **relatively unbiased** but have **high variance** — and decision trees fit this description perfectly.

- Deep, unpruned decision trees tend to have **low bias**, as they can closely fit the training data and capture complex patterns.
- However, they also suffer from **high variance**: small changes or perturbations in the training data can lead to drastically different tree structures and predictions.
- By training many such high-variance trees on different bootstrap samples and **averaging** their outputs, bagging **reduces the overall variance** without significantly affecting the bias.

The result is a **more stable, robust, and accurate ensemble model** compared to relying on a single decision tree.

Thus, decision trees are an ideal candidate for bagging — their natural instability becomes an advantage when combined through this technique.

With this understanding in place, we are now ready to move toward an even more powerful idea: **Random Forests** - where we take bagging one step further by adding an extra layer of randomness to make our ensemble even stronger!
