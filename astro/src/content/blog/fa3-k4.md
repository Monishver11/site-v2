This is the in-depth companion to the [K4 section of the FA3 worklog](/blog/fa3-worklog/). Refer back there for the high-level idea — WGMMA replaces both scalar GEMMs, K4.1 launders through SMEM, K4.2 keeps everything in registers. This post covers the mechanics: WGMMA from first principles, the CuTe API surface, the K4.1 walkthrough, TV layouts properly, the K4.2 register softmax and register handoff, and the V mode-order fix.

Two kernel files: `kernels/k4_qk.py` (`K4QKFMHA`) and `kernels/k4.py` (`K4FMHA`) in the [project repo](https://github.com/Monishver11/FlashAttention3.git).

## WGMMA from first principles

### The unit

WGMMA (Warp-Group Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) is the SM90 warpgroup-level MMA instruction. One issue computes

$$ C \mathrel{+}= A \cdot B $$

at warpgroup granularity (128 threads, 4 warps), with hardware doing all of the multiply-add work on the tensor cores. Three defining properties:

- **Warpgroup-collective.** All 128 threads of a warpgroup must issue the same WGMMA together. Hardware reads operand fragments from those 128 threads' registers and writes the output fragment back to the same 128 threads.
- **Asynchronous.** WGMMA returns immediately. The math actually happens in the tensor-core pipeline; you have to fence and wait when you want to read the result.
- **Atom-shaped.** The instruction operates on a fixed shape per issue, $M \times N \times K$. For SM90 BF16, the atom is $64 \times N \times 16$ with $N \in \{8, 16, \ldots, 256\}$. Larger matmuls are built by iterating WGMMA calls over the K axis (the "k_block" loop).

### Atom shape vs per-thread fragment

The atom shape (say $64 \times 64 \times 16$ for our QK config) is the shape of the *warpgroup-level tile*. One WGMMA call produces $64 \times 64 = 4096$ output elements cooperatively across 128 threads. Each thread therefore holds $4096 / 128 = 32$ output elements in its registers. Those 32 elements are **not** a clean sub-rectangle of the tile; they are scattered across the tile in a hardware-defined pattern.

The pattern is described by the C TV layout (`tv_layout_C`), which we'll unpack properly when K4.2 needs it. For K4.1 the only thing you need to know is: *the C-fragment is per-thread, the 32 elements are at specific tile positions decided by hardware, and you read them via a coordinate tensor that tells you which tile position each fragment slot maps to*.

The same scattering applies to A and B operands when they come from registers. K4.1 takes both A (Q) and B (K) from SMEM, so the per-thread A/B fragments are layout reinterpretations rather than real register holdings, and we don't have to think about them. K4.2 changes this for PV's A operand.

### Operand sources and the 8 variants

WGMMA constrains where its operands can come from:

- **A** can come from SMEM **or** registers (RF).
- **B** can come **only** from SMEM.
- **C** is always the register accumulator (RF).

For each SMEM operand, the leading axis (the axis that's contiguous in memory) can be either K-major or MN-major. With 2 choices for A source × 2 for A major × 2 for B major, the WGMMA hardware exposes 8 distinct variants per dtype and shape. Swizzle isn't a separate axis; each major mode admits a small set of swizzle patterns, encoded into the SMEM descriptor at issue time.

K4.1 uses **A from SMEM (K-major), B from SMEM (K-major)** for QK. Both Q and K have $d$ contiguous in SMEM, and $d$ is the contraction axis of QK, so K-major is natural for both.

### SMEM descriptors

When A or B come from SMEM, the WGMMA instruction reads them via a 64-bit **SMEM descriptor**: a packed value encoding the operand tile's start address, swizzle pattern, leading-dim stride, and a few flags. The descriptor describes the operand tile for one WGMMA call (one k_block); for a full-K matmul we issue multiple WGMMAs, each with a descriptor pointing at the next K-slice.

You never construct these descriptors by hand. The tiled MMA object plus the SMEM layout produced by the sm90 helpers carry enough information that `cute.gemm` builds descriptors at issue time.

### The async pattern: fence / commit_group / wait_group

Three primitives at three different roles:

**`fence()`** is a *register fence*. It does not wait. It tells the WGMMA pipeline that the current state of register operands is final and may be consumed by the next WGMMA issue. Place it before the WGMMAs that read those registers.

**`commit_group()`** is a tagging operation. It does not wait. It bundles all WGMMAs issued since the last commit into a named group ("call this batch group #N"). You issue, you commit, you wait on the group.

**`wait_group(N)`** is the one that actually blocks. It waits until at most $N$ committed groups remain in flight. `wait_group(0)` blocks until all prior commits have completed.

The argument $N$ exists for pipelining: K6 will issue group A, commit, issue group B, commit, then `wait_group(1)` ("wait for A but let B keep running"). K4 doesn't pipeline at the WGMMA level and uses `wait_group(0)`.

Standard pattern:

```text
fence()                              # register operands ready for WGMMA
for k_block in K-blocks:
    cute.gemm(tiled_mma, C, A_k, B_k, C)   # issue WGMMAs (async)
commit_group()                       # close this batch
wait_group(0)                        # wait for it
```

## CuTe's WGMMA wrapping

**Tiled MMA** (`sm90_utils.make_trivial_tiled_mma`) bundles a WGMMA atom with the TV layouts for A, B, C.

```python
qk_tiled_mma = sm90_utils.make_trivial_tiled_mma(
    INPUT_DTYPE, INPUT_DTYPE,                       # A, B dtypes (BF16)
    warpgroup.OperandMajorMode.K,                   # A major mode
    warpgroup.OperandMajorMode.K,                   # B major mode
    ACC_DTYPE,                                      # accumulator dtype (FP32)
    (1, 1, 1),                                      # atom layout (one atom per warpgroup)
    (Br, Bc),                                       # M, N of the tile
    warpgroup.OperandSource.SMEM,                   # A source (B is implicitly SMEM)
)
```

**Thread MMA** (`tiled_mma.get_slice(tidx)`) is a thread-local view that knows how to extract this thread's slice of A, B, C from the warpgroup-level tile.

**`partition_A` / `partition_B` / `partition_C`** take a source tile (SMEM, GMEM, or a coordinate tensor) and return a tensor whose layout is *this thread's slice* under the relevant operand's TV layout. View, not copy.

**`make_fragment_A` / `make_fragment_B` / `make_fragment_C`** wrap a partitioned tensor in the layout that the WGMMA instruction encoding expects.

- For SMEM-sourced operands, this is a layout reinterpretation. No register allocation.
- For register-sourced operands, this allocates registers in the per-thread fragment layout.
- For C, this *always* allocates: C is always in registers.

**`cute.gemm(tiled_mma, D, A, B, C)`** issues one WGMMA: `D = A * B + C`, with C and D typically the same accumulator. The flag `ACCUMULATE` on the tiled MMA controls whether the hardware behaviour is "C = A*B" or "C += A*B".

**Naming convention** for partitioned tensors: `t<Op><mem><Operand>`, where `Op` is `S` (QK matmul, output $S$) or `O` (PV matmul, output $O$), `mem` is `s`/`r`/`g`/`c` (SMEM/registers/GMEM/coordinates), and `Operand` is the operand name. `tSsQ` is "QK matmul, SMEM, Q operand"; `tSrK` is "QK matmul, register-fragment view, K operand."

## Swizzled SMEM layouts

K3 used plain row-major SMEM. K4 needs swizzled layouts to feed the tensor cores efficiently: the access pattern WGMMA emits when reading from SMEM hashes to specific banks under the swizzle, and the wrong layout produces conflicts that serialize the load. CuTe builds the right swizzle via `sm90_utils.make_smem_layout_a` / `make_smem_layout_b`:

```python
sQ_layout_staged = sm90_utils.make_smem_layout_a(
    q_layout_enum, mma_tile_mnk, INPUT_DTYPE, q_stage,
)
sK_layout_staged = sm90_utils.make_smem_layout_b(
    k_layout_enum, mma_tile_mnk, INPUT_DTYPE, kv_stage,
)
```

The helpers return a `ComposedLayout`: a normal layout (`.outer`) plus a swizzle function (`.inner`). At SMEM allocation time we pass both:

```python
sQ_full = storage.sQ.get_tensor(
    sQ_layout_staged.outer, swizzle=sQ_layout_staged.inner,
)
```

From here on, indexing `sQ_full[i, j]` returns the value at the swizzled offset; you don't see the permutation, but the tensor cores do. The TMA atom and the WGMMA descriptor both derive from this single layout object, so producer and consumer agree by construction.

<!-- TODO: specific swizzle pattern (32B/64B/128B) chosen by the helper for our config -->

## K4.1 walkthrough

### The QK matmul

Setup before the mainloop:

```python
qk_thr_mma = qk_tiled_mma.get_slice(tidx)
tSsQ = qk_thr_mma.partition_A(sQ_full)           # (MMA, MMA_M, MMA_K, q_stage)
tSsK = qk_thr_mma.partition_B(sK_full)           # (MMA, MMA_N, MMA_K, kv_stage)
tSrQ = qk_tiled_mma.make_fragment_A(tSsQ)        # layout reinterpretation
tSrK = qk_tiled_mma.make_fragment_B(tSsK)        # layout reinterpretation
qk_acc_shape = qk_thr_mma.partition_shape_C((Br, Bc))
```

`partition_A` and `partition_B` produce per-thread views into the SMEM-staged tiles. The mode structure `(MMA, MMA_M, MMA_K, q_stage)` means "per-WGMMA-issue chunk, M-tile coord, K-block coord, pipeline stage." The K-block coord is what we iterate over inside the WGMMA loop.

`partition_shape_C` returns the per-thread C fragment's shape but doesn't allocate. The allocation happens inside the mainloop, fresh per KV iteration.

Inside the mainloop:

```python
acc_qk = qk_thr_mma.make_fragment_C(qk_acc_shape)
cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.fence()

tSrQ_k = tSrQ[(None, None, None, q_consumer_state.index)]
tSrK_k = tSrK[(None, None, None, kv_consumer_state.index)]
num_k_blocks = cute.size(tSrQ_k, mode=[2])      # = d / 16

for k_block_idx in range_constexpr(num_k_blocks):
    qk_tiled_mma.set(
        cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.Field.ACCUMULATE, k_block_idx != 0,
    )
    cute.gemm(
        qk_tiled_mma, acc_qk,
        tSrQ_k[(None, None, k_block_idx)],
        tSrK_k[(None, None, k_block_idx)],
        acc_qk,
    )

cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.commit_group()
cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.wait_group(0)
```

Five things going on:

**1. `make_fragment_C` allocates the per-thread C fragment** as 32 FP32 registers (for the 64×64 atom). Initial register state is undefined.

**2. `fence()` marks the register state as ready for WGMMA consumption.** Strictly not required here (the first WGMMA will overwrite C because `ACCUMULATE=False`), but the canonical pattern has the fence before the gemm loop.

**3. Slice down to this iteration's stages.** The stage axis of `tSrQ`/`tSrK` gets fixed; the remaining mode is the k_block axis.

**4. The k_block loop.** The atom's K axis is 16 BF16 elements wide. For QK contraction length $d$, we issue `d / 16` WGMMAs in sequence, each accumulating into the same `acc_qk`. The `ACCUMULATE` flag is the trick: `False` on the first issue (write the accumulator), `True` on the rest (add to it). For $d = 64$: 4 WGMMAs; for $d = 128$: 8.

**5. `commit_group()` + `wait_group(0)`** close the batch and wait. After `wait_group(0)` returns, `acc_qk` holds the per-thread fragment of $S = QK^\top$ in FP32.

### The coord-tensor scatter to `sS`

`acc_qk` is a register fragment under the WGMMA C TV layout. To write it back to a plain $(B_r, B_c)$ SMEM tile, we use an **identity tensor**: a logical tile that, when indexed, returns the *coordinate tuple* itself.

```python
cS = cute.make_identity_tensor((Br, Bc))     # cS[m, n] = (m, n)
tScS = qk_thr_mma.partition_C(cS)             # partition the same way as C
```

`cS` carries no real storage. After `partition_C(cS)`, `tScS` is the per-thread view of `cS` *under exactly the same TV layout that `acc_qk` lives under*. So for each fragment slot of `acc_qk`, the corresponding slot of `tScS` tells you what $(m, n)$ tile coordinate that slot represents.

Indexing both under their mn-view makes the scatter mechanical:

```python
acc_qk_mn = cute.make_tensor(
    acc_qk.iterator, layout_acc_mn(qk_tiled_mma, acc_qk.layout),
)
tScS_mn = cute.make_tensor(
    tScS.iterator, layout_acc_mn(qk_tiled_mma, tScS.layout),
)

for i in range_constexpr(cute.size(acc_qk_mn, mode=[0])):
    for j in range_constexpr(cute.size(acc_qk_mn, mode=[1])):
        m_idx = tScS_mn[i, j][0]
        n_idx = tScS_mn[i, j][1]
        val = acc_qk_mn[i, j] * scale
        if const_expr(causal):
            q_abs  = bidx_m * Br + m_idx
            kv_abs = j_outer * Bc + n_idx
            if kv_abs > q_abs:
                val = -inf
        sS[m_idx, n_idx] = val
cute.arch.sync_threads()
```

`layout_acc_mn` produces an mn-view of the per-thread fragment (mode 0 walks M-direction slots, mode 1 walks N-direction slots; details later in this post). For K4.1 the interpretation is: each thread sweeps `(i, j)` over its own fragment, asks `tScS_mn` for the actual tile coordinate, and writes the scaled value to `sS` at that coordinate.

After the scatter and the sync, `sS` contains the full $S = QK^\top \cdot \text{scale}$ tile in row-major SMEM, identical in layout to K3's `sS`. The K3 softmax and the K3 hand-rolled PV run against it unchanged. The price is a 16 KB SMEM round-trip per iteration ($64 \times 64$ FP32). K4.2 removes that round-trip, which is what forces it to deal with the WGMMA C-layout directly.

## TV layouts, properly (K4.2 needs these)

A **TV layout** is a CuTe layout whose two top-level modes are interpreted as $(T, V)$: Thread index and Value index within that thread. It's a function

$$ (T,\; V) \;\longrightarrow\; \text{tile\_position} $$

that says, for every thread $T$ and every value slot $V$ in that thread's fragment, which position in the underlying tile that pair refers to. Mechanically it's still a CuTe layout (shape and stride); the convention is just that the first mode counts threads and the second counts values per thread.

Every tiled MMA exposes three:

```python
tiled_mma.tv_layout_A
tiled_mma.tv_layout_B
tiled_mma.tv_layout_C
```

The crucial property of WGMMA C-layouts on SM90: **both the Thread mode and the Value mode contribute to both M and N of the tile**. Some sub-bits of the thread index walk along M; others walk along N. Same for the value index. This is why a single thread's fragment is not a clean sub-rectangle of the tile.

### Concrete numbers: SM90 BF16, 64×64 C tile

For our QK atom (M=N=64, K=16), the C TV layout shape resolves roughly to:

```
tv_layout_C.shape  =  ( (4, 32),    ((2, 2), 8) )
                      ^^^^^^^^      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                      Threads (T)   Values (V)
```

128 threads ($4 \times 32$) each holding 32 values ($2 \times 2 \times 8$). Per thread:

| Quantity                  | Value | Meaning                                        |
| :------------------------ | :---- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Total threads             | 128   | one warpgroup                                  |
| Total tile elements       | 4096  | $64 \times 64$                               |
| Values per thread         | 32    | $4096 / 128$                                 |
| Distinct M rows / thread  | 2     | mn-view mode 0                                 |
| Distinct N cols / thread  | 16    | mn-view mode 1                                 |
| Threads sharing a row     | 4     | for cross-thread row max / sum                 |
| Threads on different rows | 32    | $128 / 4$                                    |

Two things from this table drive the K4.2 softmax:

- Each thread owns **2 distinct M rows**, not one. Per-row state arrays (`s_max`, `a_sum`, `s_max_prev`) must have length 2, not be a single scalar.
- Each M row is shared by **4 threads**. Row max and row sum reduce across those 4 sibling threads.

### The stride-versus-M test

To peel apart "this sub-mode walks along M" from "this sub-mode walks along N" inside a hierarchical Thread or Value mode, CuTe uses a simple test. Picture the tile flattened M-major into a 1D buffer of $M \cdot N$ entries. Addresses $0 \ldots M-1$ form M-row 0, $M \ldots 2M-1$ form M-row 1, and so on. Then:

- A stride $< M$ moves within a single row → walks along M.
- A stride $\geq M$ moves across rows → walks along N.

Two K4.2 utilities use this test: `layout_acc_mn` (peels the value mode) and `reduction_target_n` (peels the thread mode). Both call into a shared helper, `layout_separate`.

## The K4.2 helpers

### `layout_separate`

```python
@staticmethod
def layout_separate(thr, src, ref):
    lt = cute.make_layout(())
    ge = cute.make_layout(())
    for k, v in enumerate(ref):
        if cutlass.const_expr(v < thr):
            lt = cute.append(lt, src[k])
        else:
            ge = cute.append(ge, src[k])
    # ... rank-1 packaging
```

Given a layout `src` and a parallel list of strides `ref`, it splits `src`'s sub-modes into two buckets: those whose corresponding stride in `ref` is $<$ `thr` go into `lt` (M-walking part), the rest go into `ge` (N-walking part). In K4.2 `thr` is always `tiled_mma.shape_mnk[0] = M`.

### `layout_acc_mn`

The per-thread C fragment naturally has shape `(value_mode, M_tile_coord, N_tile_coord)`. We want an mn-view where mode 0 walks distinct M rows owned by this thread and mode 1 walks distinct N columns.

```python
@cute.jit
def layout_acc_mn(self, tiled_mma, acc):
    separated = self.layout_separate(
        tiled_mma.shape_mnk[0], acc[0], tiled_mma.tv_layout_C.stride[1]
    )
    V_M = separated[0]
    V_N = separated[1]
    # compose with acc[1] (M-tile) and acc[2] (N-tile)
    return cute.append(V_M_with_tile, V_N_with_tile)
```

The reference strides are `tv_layout_C.stride[1]` — the value mode's strides (the `[1]` selects the value side of TV: shape = (T, V), so [0] is threads and [1] is values). After the split, the fragment is reorganised into `(M-walking, N-walking)` shape.

Indexing the result `acc_mn[i, j]`: $i$ walks only along M-bits → distinct M rows of the tile; $j$ walks only along N-bits → distinct N columns. `cute.size(acc_mn, mode=[0])` gives the number of distinct M rows this thread owns: 2 for the 64×64 atom.

```python
n_rows    = cute.size(acc_pv_mn, mode=[0])      # 2
n_cols_pv = cute.size(acc_pv_mn, mode=[1])      # 16 for d=64, 32 for d=128
n_cols_qk = cute.size(acc_qk_mn, mode=[1])      # 16 for Bc=64
```

### `reduction_target_n`

```python
@cute.jit
def reduction_target_n(self, tiled_mma):
    separated = self.layout_separate(
        tiled_mma.shape_mnk[0],
        cute.make_layout(tiled_mma.tv_layout_C.shape[0]),
        tiled_mma.tv_layout_C.stride[0],
    )
    return separated[1]   # the N-walking part of the thread mode
```

Same `layout_separate` machinery applied to the **thread** mode. Returns the part of the thread index whose stride is $\geq M$ — the bits that walk along N. Threads that differ only in those bits are siblings on the same row.

For our 64×64 atom, this returns a 1-rank layout with shape `[4]`: 4 sibling threads per row. The K4.2 reduction iterates over the sub-modes and does a sub-warp shuffle whose group size is each sub-mode's extent:

```python
reduction_target_qk = self.reduction_target_n(qk_tiled_mma)
red_rank_qk = cute.rank(reduction_target_qk)

for r in range_constexpr(red_rank_qk):
    for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
        s_max[i] = cute.arch.warp_reduction_max(
            s_max[i], threads_in_group=reduction_target_qk.shape[r],
        )
```

Deriving the group size from `reduction_target_n` rather than hardcoding 4 means the same softmax works for any atom shape CuTe gives us.

## The K4.2 register softmax

Per-row state lives in register tensors of length `n_rows`:

```python
s_max_layout = cute.make_layout(n_rows)
s_max      = cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(s_max_layout, cutlass.Float32)
a_sum      = cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(s_max, cutlass.Float32)
s_max_prev = cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(s_max, cutlass.Float32)
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    s_max[i] = -inf
    a_sum[i] = 0.0
```

`acc_pv` is allocated **once before the mainloop**, zero-initialised, and accumulates across all KV iterations:

```python
acc_pv = pv_thr_mma.make_fragment_C(pv_acc_shape)
acc_pv_mn = cute.make_tensor(
    acc_pv.iterator, layout_acc_mn(pv_tiled_mma, acc_pv.layout),
)
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_pv):
        acc_pv_mn[i, j] = 0.0
```

The zero-init makes the unified rescale benign on iter 0: with `s_max_prev = -inf` and `s_max` finite, `scale_pv = exp(-inf) = 0`, and `0 * 0 = 0`, so the rescale silently does nothing on the first iteration.

Inside the mainloop, after QK has produced `acc_qk`:

```python
acc_qk_mn = cute.make_tensor(
    acc_qk.iterator, layout_acc_mn(qk_tiled_mma, acc_qk.layout),
)

# 1. Scale
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_qk):
        acc_qk_mn[i, j] *= scale

# 2. Causal mask
if const_expr(causal):
    for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
        for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_qk):
            q_abs  = q_block_offset  + tScS_mn[i, j][0]
            kv_abs = kv_block_offset + tScS_mn[i, j][1]
            if kv_abs > q_abs:
                acc_qk_mn[i, j] = -inf

# 3. Save prev row max, new local row max, cross-thread reduce
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    s_max_prev[i] = s_max[i]
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_qk):
        s_max[i] = fmax(s_max[i], acc_qk_mn[i, j])
for r in range_constexpr(red_rank_qk):
    for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
        s_max[i] = warp_reduction_max(
            s_max[i], threads_in_group=reduction_target_qk.shape[r],
        )

# 4. Per-row rescale of acc_pv and a_sum
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    scale_pv = exp(s_max_prev[i] - s_max[i])
    a_sum[i] *= scale_pv
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_pv):
        acc_pv_mn[i, j] *= scale_pv

# 5. P = exp(S - s_max) in-place into acc_qk, accumulate local row sum
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_qk):
        p = exp(acc_qk_mn[i, j] - s_max[i])
        acc_qk_mn[i, j] = p
        a_sum[i] += p
```

Three things to note:

- Same FA2 recurrence as K2/K3, expressed against the per-thread fragment layout.
- Step 5 overwrites `acc_qk` in place with $P$. After this point `acc_qk` is the (unnormalised) attention weights, not the score block.
- The `a_sum` cross-thread reduction is *deferred* to the finalize stage. Each thread accumulates `a_sum[i]` over only the N columns it owns; the full row sum is computed once after all KV iterations.

## The QK→PV register handoff: `make_acc_into_op`

`acc_qk` holds $P$ in FP32 under the WGMMA C TV layout. PV wants its A operand in registers, in BF16, under the WGMMA A TV layout. The handoff has to do three things: cast FP32 → BF16, reinterpret the register layout C → A, and avoid moving bytes between threads.

```python
@cute.jit
def make_acc_into_op(self, acc, operand_layout_tv, Element):
    operand = cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(
        self.convert_c_layout_to_a_layout(acc.layout, operand_layout_tv.shape[1]),
        Element,
    )
    operand_as_acc = cute.make_tensor(operand.iterator, acc.layout)
    acc_vec = acc.load()
    operand_as_acc.store(acc_vec.to(Element))
    return operand
```

Step 1: allocate an A-layout register fragment in BF16.

```python
operand = cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(
    convert_c_layout_to_a_layout(acc.layout, ...),
    Element,    # BF16
)
```

`convert_c_layout_to_a_layout` reshapes the C-fragment layout into the A-fragment layout that physically aligns with how WGMMA expects A. This works because the SM90 WGMMA register layouts for C and A are designed to be reinterpretable into one another *without inter-thread shuffles for BF16*, precisely to make QK→PV through registers efficient.

```python
@staticmethod
def convert_c_layout_to_a_layout(c, a):
    return cute.make_layout(
        (a, c.shape[1], (c.shape[2], cute.size(c, mode=[0]) // cute.size(a))),
        stride=(c.stride[0], c.stride[1],
                (c.stride[2], cute.size(a, mode=[2]) * c.stride[0][2])),
    )
```

This is a CUTLASS C++ idiom ported into Python. The precise arithmetic isn't load-bearing; the takeaway is that the output describes an A-shaped layout pointing at the *same physical registers* as the input C-shaped layout.

Step 2: build an aliasing view.

```python
operand_as_acc = cute.make_tensor(operand.iterator, acc.layout)
```

Same iterator (same registers as `operand`), C-shaped layout (same as `acc`). One register region, two views.

Step 3: cast and store via the C view.

```python
acc_vec = acc.load()                             # read all of acc (FP32, C-layout)
operand_as_acc.store(acc_vec.to(Element))        # write back as BF16 via the C view
```

Reading is C-shaped (matches `acc`); writing routes the FP32→BF16 cast into the registers that will be read by WGMMA under the A-layout. The cast happens in registers, no SMEM, no shuffles.

> **FP8 caveat.** The "no inter-thread shuffles" property holds for BF16. FP8 breaks it because the per-element bit width changes the per-thread register packing, and the cleanest BF16 reinterpretation no longer maps the right bytes to the right threads. K7 needs extra shuffles in `make_acc_into_op`.

## V's mode-order trap

$V$ stores the same physical bytes as $K$: row-major $(N, d, B)$ with $d$ contiguous. But $V$ plays a different role in PV than $K$ plays in QK, and this changes which axis is "the contraction axis."

For **QK**, $K$ is the B operand and the contraction is $d$. $K$'s contiguous axis is $d$, which is QK's K axis. So $K$ is K-major.

For **PV**, $V$ is the B operand and the contraction is $B_c$. $V$'s contiguous axis is still $d$, but for PV that's the N axis, not the K axis. So $V$ needs to be **MN-major** for PV.

WGMMA needs the right major-mode label on its B operand, and the right matching SMEM layout. The cleanest way to get both ends to agree is to re-view $V$ at kernel entry with mode order $(d, k, l)$ instead of $(k, d, l)$ — the bytes are unchanged, but CuTe now sees $d$ as the leading axis:

```python
mV = cute.make_tensor(mV.iterator, cute.select(mV.layout, [1, 0, 2]))
```

After the re-view, `LayoutEnum.from_tensor(mV)` returns `COL_MAJOR` and `sm90_mma_major_mode()` returns MN. The SMEM helper builds an MN-major layout, the PV tiled MMA picks the right WGMMA variant, and the TMA atom loads $V$ into the right SMEM shape with tile $(d, B_c)$. Same memory bytes throughout; only the labels change.

## Building the PV tiled MMA

```python
pv_tiled_mma = sm90_utils.make_trivial_tiled_mma(
    INPUT_DTYPE, INPUT_DTYPE,
    warpgroup.OperandMajorMode.K,            # A = P, K-major
    v_layout_enum.sm90_mma_major_mode(),     # B = V, MN-major from the re-view
    ACC_DTYPE,
    (1, 1, 1),
    (Br, d),                                 # M, N of the tile (N is now d)
    warpgroup.OperandSource.RMEM,            # A comes from registers
)
```

Two things changed relative to the QK tiled MMA:

- M/N of the tile is `(Br, d)` instead of `(Br, Bc)`. PV result is $(B_r, d)$, matching $O_i$.
- `OperandSource.RMEM` for A. WGMMA reads A from registers; we'll pass the BF16 fragment returned by `make_acc_into_op` directly.

The PV SMEM layout for V:

```python
pv_mma_tile_mnk = (Br, d, Bc)
sV_layout_staged = sm90_utils.make_smem_layout_b(
    v_layout_enum, pv_mma_tile_mnk, INPUT_DTYPE, kv_stage,
)
```

The (N, K) of B for this matmul is `(d, Bc)`, which matches our re-viewed $V$'s `(d, k, l)` shape. The TMA atom for V correspondingly takes tile shape `(d, Bc)`.

## The PV WGMMA

```python
tOrP = self.make_acc_into_op(acc_qk, pv_tiled_mma.tv_layout_A, INPUT_DTYPE)

cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.fence()
tOrV_k = tOrV[(None, None, None, kv_consumer_state.index)]
num_k_blocks_pv = cute.size(tOrP, mode=[2])
for k_block_idx in range_constexpr(num_k_blocks_pv):
    pv_tiled_mma.set(Field.ACCUMULATE, True)
    cute.gemm(
        pv_tiled_mma, acc_pv,
        tOrP[(None, None, k_block_idx)],
        tOrV_k[(None, None, k_block_idx)],
        acc_pv,
    )
cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.commit_group()
cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.wait_group(0)
```

Three differences from K4.1's QK call:

**`ACCUMULATE` is always `True`.** `acc_pv` is the running attention output across all KV iterations. Every PV WGMMA adds to whatever `acc_pv` already holds. There's no "first call writes the accumulator" case for PV.

**A comes from registers.** `tOrP` is the BF16 A-layout fragment built via `make_acc_into_op`. The k_block axis lives in `tOrP`'s mode 2: `num_k_blocks_pv = cute.size(tOrP, mode=[2])`. For $B_c = 64$ and atom $K = 16$, that's 4 k_blocks.

**The PV fence applies to the A operand.** The QK fence was largely cosmetic; this one is functional, marking the registers in `tOrP` as ready for WGMMA after the softmax and `make_acc_into_op` cast.

## Finalize

Two pieces.

**Cross-thread `a_sum` reduce.** Throughout the mainloop each thread accumulated `a_sum[i]` over only the N columns it owns. The actual row sum requires combining with the 3 sibling threads. Done once, at the end, using `reduction_target_n` on the PV tiled MMA:

```python
reduction_target_pv = self.reduction_target_n(pv_tiled_mma)
red_rank_pv = cute.rank(reduction_target_pv)
for r in range_constexpr(red_rank_pv):
    for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
        a_sum[i] = cute.arch.warp_reduction_sum(
            a_sum[i], threads_in_group=reduction_target_pv.shape[r],
        )
```

**Output scatter with a coord tensor.** `acc_pv` is in registers under the PV C TV layout. Same fix as K4.1's `acc_qk`: probe with an identity tensor partitioned through `partition_C`, write to GMEM at the per-thread tile coordinates.

```python
cO = cute.make_identity_tensor((Br, d))
tOcO = pv_thr_mma.partition_C(cO)
tOcO_mn = cute.make_tensor(
    tOcO.iterator, layout_acc_mn(pv_tiled_mma, tOcO.layout),
)
for i in range_constexpr(n_rows):
    inv_l = cute.arch.rcp_approx(a_sum[i])
    if a_sum[i] == 0.0 or a_sum[i] != a_sum[i]:
        inv_l = 1.0
    for j in range_constexpr(n_cols_pv):
        m_idx = tOcO_mn[i, j][0]
        n_idx = tOcO_mn[i, j][1]
        gO_tile[m_idx, n_idx] = (acc_pv_mn[i, j] * inv_l).to(OUTPUT_DTYPE)
```

Per thread: for each of its 2 rows, compute $1 / \ell_i$, then for each of its `n_cols_pv` owned N columns look up the actual $(M, N)$ tile coordinate from `tOcO_mn` and write the divided value. With 128 threads each writing $n_\text{rows} \cdot n_\text{cols\_pv}$ slots, every position in the $B_r \times d$ output tile is written exactly once.

## New CuTe primitives in K4

WGMMA-specific:
- `sm90_utils.make_smem_layout_a` / `make_smem_layout_b` — swizzled SMEM layouts.
- `sm90_utils.make_trivial_tiled_mma` — bundle a WGMMA atom with TV layouts.
- `tiled_mma.get_slice(tidx)` — thread-local view of the warpgroup tile.
- `thr_mma.partition_A` / `partition_B` / `partition_C` — per-thread views under the operand's TV layout.
- `tiled_mma.make_fragment_A` / `B` / `C` — wrap a partitioned tensor in the WGMMA-expected layout.
- `thr_mma.partition_shape_C` — per-thread C fragment shape.
- `cute.gemm(tiled_mma, D, A, B, C)` — issue one WGMMA.
- `tiled_mma.set(Field.ACCUMULATE, bool)` — control add-or-overwrite.
- `cute.nvgpu.warpgroup.fence` / `commit_group` / `wait_group(n)` — the async issue protocol.

Layout and register utilities:
- `cute.make_identity_tensor((M, N))` — coordinate-reporting tile.
- `cute.make_rmem_tensor_like(layout, dtype)` — register tensor with a given layout and dtype.
- `cute.select(layout, indices)` — re-view a tensor with a different mode order (used for the V transpose).
- `cute.append`, `cute.make_layout(())` — building blocks for `layout_separate`.
- `tensor.load()` / `tensor.store(vec)` — bulk read/write of a register tensor as a single value vector.
- `cute.rank(layout)` — number of top-level modes.
- `cute.size(tensor, mode=[k])` — extent of mode $k$.

Project-level helpers built on top of the above and reused by K5+:
- `layout_separate`, `layout_acc_mn`, `reduction_target_n`, `convert_c_layout_to_a_layout`, `make_acc_into_op`.
