## **Motivation**  

So far, most of the classification algorithms we have encountered focus on **binary classification**, where the goal is to distinguish between two classes. For instance, sentiment analysis classifies text as either **positive or negative**, while spam filters differentiate between **spam and non-spam** emails.  

However, real-world problems often involve more than two categories, making binary classification insufficient. **Document classification** may require labeling articles into over **ten** categories, **object recognition** must identify objects among **thousands of classes**, and **face recognition** must distinguish between **millions** of individuals.  

As the number of classes grows, several challenges arise. **Computation cost** increases significantly, especially when training separate models for each class. Additionally, some classes might have far fewer examples than others, leading to **class imbalance** issues. Finally, in some cases, **different types of errors** have varying consequences—for example, misidentifying a handwritten "3" as an "8" might be less problematic than confusing a stop sign with a yield sign in an autonomous driving system.  

Given these challenges, we need effective strategies to extend binary classification techniques to handle multiple classes efficiently.

## **Reducing Multiclass to Binary Classification**  

A natural way to approach multiclass classification is by reducing it to **multiple binary classification problems**. One naive approach is to represent each class using a unique binary code and train a classifier to predict the code (000, 001, 010). Another approach is to apply **regression**, where each class is assigned a numerical value (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), and the model predicts a continuous number that is rounded to the nearest class. However, these methods often fail in practice due to poor generalization.  

Instead, two well-established techniques are commonly used:  

1. **One-vs-All (OvA), also called One-vs-Rest**  
2. **All-vs-All (AvA), also known as One-vs-One**  

These methods decompose the problem into smaller binary classification tasks while ensuring that the final model can still distinguish between all classes.  

---

## **One-vs-All (OvA)**  

The **One-vs-All** (OvA) approach works by training **one binary classifier per class**. Each classifier is responsible for distinguishing a single class from all the others.  

### **Training**  

Given a dataset with $k$ classes, we train $k$ separate classifiers:  

- Each classifier $h_i$ learns to recognize class $i$ as **positive (+1)** while treating all other classes as **negative (-1)**.  
- Formally, each classifier is a function $h_i: X \to \mathbb{R}$, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of belonging to class $i$.  

### **Prediction**  

When a new input $x$ is given, we evaluate all $k$ classifiers and select the class with the highest score:  

$$ h(x) = \arg\max_{i \in \{1, \dots, k\}} h_i(x) $$  

If multiple classifiers output the same score, we can resolve ties arbitrarily.  


### **Example: 3-Class Problem**  
![Multiclass-1](/img/Multiclass-1.png)
Consider a classification task with three categories: **cats, dogs, and rabbits**. Using OvA, we train three classifiers:  

1. A classifier that distinguishes **cats** from **dogs and rabbits**.  
2. A classifier that distinguishes **dogs** from **cats and rabbits**.  
3. A classifier that distinguishes **rabbits** from **cats and dogs**.  

At test time, each classifier produces a score, and the class with the highest score is selected.  

However, this method has some limitations. If the data is **not linearly separable**, the decision boundaries can become ambiguous. Additionally, if one class has far fewer examples than others, the classifier for that class might be undertrained, leading to **class imbalance issues**.

## **All-vs-All (AvA)**  

A more refined approach is **All-vs-All (AvA)**, also known as **One-vs-One**. Instead of training one classifier per class, we train a **separate classifier for each pair of classes**.  

### **Training**  

For a dataset with $k$ classes, we train $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ binary classifiers:  

- Each classifier $h_{ij}$ is trained to distinguish class $i$ from class $j$.  
- Formally, each classifier $h_{ij}: X \to \mathbb{R}$ outputs a score, where a positive value indicates class $i$, and a negative value indicates class $j$.  

### **Prediction**  

At test time, each classifier makes a decision between its assigned two classes. Each class receives a **vote** based on the number of times it wins in pairwise comparisons. The final prediction is the class with the most votes:  

$$
h(x) = \arg\max_{i \in \{1, \dots, k\}} \sum_{j \ne i} [
\underbrace{h_{ij}(x)\mathbb{I}\{i < j\}}_{\text{class } i \text{ is } +1} 
- 
\underbrace{h_{ji}(x)\mathbb{I}\{j < i\}}_{\text{class } i \text{ is } -1}
]
$$

Again, in scenarios where multiple classes receive the same number of votes, a tournament-style approach can be used to break ties. Here, classes compete in a series of pairwise matchups, and the winner of each round advances until only one class remains—the final prediction.

### **Example: 4-Class Problem**  
![Multiclass-3](/img/Multiclass-3.png)
Suppose we have four classes. Using AvA, we train six classifiers:  

1. A classifier for **cats vs. dogs**  
2. A classifier for **cats vs. rabbits**  
3. A classifier for **cats vs. birds**  
4. A classifier for **dogs vs. rabbits**  
5. A classifier for **dogs vs. birds**  
6. A classifier for **rabbits vs. birds**  

At test time, each classifier votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is chosen as the final prediction.  

This method has **better decision boundaries** than OvA because it learns finer distinctions between pairs of classes. However, it is **computationally expensive** for large $k$, as the number of classifiers grows quadratically.

## **OvA vs. AvA: Trade-offs**  

Both approaches have their own advantages and limitations. In general:  

- **OvA is simpler** and requires fewer models, but it suffers from **class imbalance issues**.  
- **AvA provides better decision boundaries** but is **computationally expensive**, especially for large numbers of classes.  

The following table summarizes the computational complexity of both methods:  

---

|  | **OvA** | **AvA** |  
|---|---|---|  
| **Training Complexity** | $O(k B_{\text{train}}(n))$ | $O(k^2 B_{\text{train}}(n/k))$ |  
| **Testing Complexity** | $O(k B_{\text{test}})$ | $O(k^2 B_{\text{test}})$ |  
| **Challenges** | Class imbalance, poor calibration | Small training sets, tie-breaking |  

--- 

- **$k$**: The **number of classes** in the multiclass classification problem.

- **$B_{\text{train}}(n)$**: The **computational cost of training** a binary classifier on **$n$** training examples.

- **$B_{\text{test}}$**: The **computational cost of testing** a single input using one binary classifier.


- For **One-vs-All (OvA)**:
  - **Training**:
    - Train $k$ classifiers, each on the **entire dataset** with $n$ examples.
    - **Total training cost**: $O(k \cdot B_{\text{train}}(n))$
  - **Testing**:
    - For each new input, all $k$ classifiers are evaluated.
    - **Total testing cost per input**: $O(k \cdot B_{\text{test}})$

- For **All-vs-All (AvA)**:
  - **Training**:
    - Train $\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \approx O(k^2)$ classifiers.
    - Each classifier uses data from only **two classes**, approximately $n/k$ examples.
    - **Total training cost**: $O(k^2 \cdot B_{\text{train}}(n/k))$
  - **Testing**:
    - For each new input, all $O(k^2)$ classifiers are evaluated.
    - **Total testing cost per input**: $O(k^2 \cdot B_{\text{test}})$


While these reduction-based approaches work well for **small numbers of classes**, they become impractical when scaling to large datasets.

### **Conclusion**  

We explored two fundamental approaches for handling multiclass classification by **reducing it to multiple binary classification problems**:  

- **One-vs-All (OvA)**: Train one classifier per class.  
- **All-vs-All (AvA)**: Train one classifier per pair of classes.  

Although these methods are simple and effective for small datasets, they become computationally expensive as the number of classes grows. For example, **ImageNet contains over 20,000 categories, and Wikipedia has over 1 million topics**, making reduction-based methods infeasible.  

### **What’s Next?**  

To overcome these challenges, we need classification algorithms that **directly generalize binary classification to multiple classes** without breaking the problem into smaller binary tasks. In the next post, we’ll explore these approaches and how they scale efficiently to large datasets. Stay tuned and See you! 👋
