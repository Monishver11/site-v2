Gaussian regression provides a **probabilistic perspective** on linear regression, enabling us to **model uncertainty** in our predictions. Unlike traditional regression techniques that provide only point estimates, Gaussian regression models the **entire distribution** over possible predictions.  

In this post, we will explore Gaussian regression through a **step-by-step example in one dimension**, gradually building intuition before moving to the **Bayesian posterior update** with multiple observations.

---

### **Gaussian Regression in One Dimension: Problem Setup**  

To understand Gaussian regression, let’s consider a simple **one-dimensional regression task**. Suppose our **input space** is:

$$
X = [-1,1]
$$

and the **output space** is:

$$
Y \subseteq \mathbb{R}
$$

We assume that for a given input $x$, the corresponding output $y$ is generated according to a **linear model** with additive Gaussian noise:

$$
y = w_0 + w_1 x + \varepsilon, \quad \text{where} \quad \varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.2^2)
$$

In other words, the output is a **linear function** of $x$ with coefficients $(w_0, w_1)$ and **Gaussian noise** $\varepsilon$ with variance $0.2^2$.  

Alternatively, we can express this in **probabilistic form** as:

$$
y \mid x, w_0, w_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(w_0 + w_1 x, 0.2^2)
$$

where the mean is given by the **linear function** $w_0 + w_1 x$, and the variance captures the **uncertainty in our observations**.

Now, the question is: **how do we model our belief about the parameters $w_0$ and $w_1$?**  

---

### **Prior Distribution Over Parameters**  

Before observing any data, we assume a **prior belief** about the parameters $w = (w_0, w_1)$. A common choice is to model the parameters as a **zero-mean Gaussian distribution**:

$$
w = (w_0, w_1) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{1}{2} I)
$$

This prior reflects our initial assumption that $w_0$ and $w_1$ are likely to be small, centered around zero, with **independent Gaussian uncertainty**.  

### **Visualizing the Prior**

- The **left plot** below illustrates samples drawn from the prior distribution over $w$.  
- The **right plot** shows **random linear functions** $y(x) = E[y \mid x, w] = w_0 + w_1 x$ drawn from this prior distribution $(w ∼ p(w))$.

Since no observations have been made yet, these functions represent **potential hypotheses** about the true relationship between $x$ and $y$.

---

### **Updating Beliefs: Posterior After One Observation**  

Once we collect data, we can update our belief about $w$ using **Bayes' theorem**. Suppose we observe a **single training point** $(x_1, y_1)$.  

This leads to a **posterior distribution** over $w$, incorporating the evidence from our observation.  
![Guassian_Regression-2](/img/Guassian_Regression-2.png)
- The **left plot** below shows the updated posterior distribution over $w$, where the **white cross** represents the true underlying parameters.  
- The **right plot** now shows **updated predictions** based on this posterior. Blue circle indicates the training observation. The red lines represent sampled functions $y(x) = E[y \mid x, w]$ drawn from the **posterior** $(w ∼ p(w \vert D) )$ instead of the prior.  


### **Key Observations After One Data Point**  
1. The **posterior distribution is more concentrated**, reflecting reduced uncertainty about $w$.  
2. Predictions near the observed point $x_1$ are more certain, while uncertainty remains high elsewhere.  

---

### **Adding More Observations: Improved Predictions**  

Let’s now extend this idea by considering multiple observations.  

**Posterior After Two Observations**  
![Guassian_Regression-3](/img/Guassian_Regression-3.png)
- With two training points, the posterior further **shrinks**, indicating **increased confidence** in our estimate of $w$.  
- The red curves on the right become more **aligned**, meaning the model has more confidence in its predictions.  

**Posterior After Twenty Observations**  
![Guassian_Regression-4](/img/Guassian_Regression-4.png)
- When we have **twenty observations**, our uncertainty about $w$ significantly decreases.  
- The predicted functions become **highly concentrated**, meaning the model has effectively **learned the underlying relationship** between $x$ and $y$.  

This progression illustrates a fundamental principle in Bayesian regression: **as we collect more data, the posterior distribution sharpens, leading to more confident predictions.**

---

So, Gaussian regression provides a **Bayesian approach to linear regression**, allowing us to **incorporate prior knowledge** and **update beliefs** as new data arrives.  

**Key takeaways:**  

1. We started with a **prior distribution** over parameters $w$.  
2. We incorporated **one observation**, updating our belief using the **posterior distribution**.  
3. As we collected **more data**, our predictions became **more confident**, reducing uncertainty in our model.  

This framework not only provides **point predictions** but also **quantifies uncertainty**, making it particularly useful for applications where knowing confidence levels is crucial.  

Next up, we will derive the **closed-form posterior distribution** for Gaussian regression and explore its connection to **ridge regression**.


---

## **Deriving the General Posterior Distribution in Gaussian Regression**  

We begin by defining the prior belief about our parameters. Suppose we have a **prior distribution** over the weights:  

$$
w \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_0)
$$

where $\Sigma_0$ represents the prior covariance matrix, encoding our initial uncertainty about $w$. Given an **observed dataset** $D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$, we assume the following **likelihood model**:  

$$
y_i \mid x_i, w \sim \mathcal{N}(w^T x_i, \sigma^2)
$$

where:  
- $X$ is the **design matrix**, consisting of all input feature vectors $x_i$,  
- $y$ is the **response column vector**, representing the observed outputs,  
- $\sigma^2$ represents the **variance of the noise** in the observations.  

Using **Bayes' theorem**, we update our belief about $w$ after observing data $D$, leading to a **Gaussian posterior distribution**:

$$
w \mid D \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_P, \Sigma_P)
$$

where the posterior mean $\mu_P$ and covariance $\Sigma_P$ are given by:

$$
\mu_P = \left( X^T X + \sigma^2 \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1} X^T y
$$

$$
\Sigma_P = \left( \sigma^{-2} X^T X + \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1}
$$

The posterior mean $\mu_P$ provides the **best estimate** of $w$ given the data, while the posterior covariance $\Sigma_P$ captures the **uncertainty** in our estimation.

---

### **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimation and Its Connection to Ridge Regression**  

While the posterior distribution fully describes the uncertainty in $w$, in practice, we often seek a **point estimate**. The **MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) estimate** of $w$ is simply the **posterior mean**:

$$
\hat{w} = \mu_P = \left( X^T X + \sigma^2 \Sigma_0^{-1} \right)^{-1} X^T y
$$

Now, let’s assume an **isotropic prior** variance:

$$
\Sigma_0 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda} I
$$

Plugging this into the MAP estimate simplifies it to:

$$
\hat{w} = \left( X^T X + \lambda I \right)^{-1} X^T y
$$

which is precisely the **ridge regression solution**.  

Thus, ridge regression can be interpreted as a **Bayesian approach** where we assume a Gaussian prior on the weights with variance controlled by $\lambda$. The larger $\lambda$, the stronger our prior belief that $w$ should remain small, leading to **regularization**.

This is because the isotropic Gaussian prior on $w$ has variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda}$. As $\lambda$ increases, the prior variance decreases, implying a stronger belief that the weights $w$ are closer to zero (more regularization). This results in a simpler model with smaller coefficients, reducing overfitting by penalizing large weights.

---

### **Understanding the Posterior Density and Ridge Regression**  

To further illustrate the connection between MAP estimation and ridge regression, let’s look at the **posterior density** of $w$ under the prior assumption $\Sigma_0 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda} I$:


$$
p(w \mid D) \propto \underbrace{\exp \left( - \frac{\lambda}{2 \sigma^2} \|w\|^2 \right)}_{\text{Prior}} \underbrace{\prod_{i=1}^{n} \exp \left( - \frac{(y_i - w^T x_i)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)}_{\text{Likelihood}}
$$

To find the **MAP estimate**, we minimize the **negative log-posterior**:


$$
\hat{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left[ -\log p(w \mid D) \right]
$$



$$
\hat{w}_{\text{MAP}} = \arg\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left[ \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2}_{\text{Log Likelihood}} + \underbrace{\lambda \|w\|^2}_{\text{Log Prior}} \right]
$$


This objective function is exactly the **ridge regression loss function**, which balances the **data likelihood** (sum of squared errors) with a **penalty on the weight magnitude**.  

Thus, we see that **MAP estimation in Bayesian regression is equivalent to ridge regression in frequentist statistics**.

### **Predictive Posterior Distribution and Uncertainty Quantification**  

Now that we have obtained the posterior distribution of $w$, we can compute the **predictive distribution** for a **new input point** $x_{\text{new}}$. Instead of providing just a single point estimate, Bayesian regression gives a **distribution over predictions**, reflecting our confidence.  

The predictive distribution is given by:

$$
p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, D) = \int p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, w) p(w \mid D) dw
$$

Averages over prediction for each $w$, weighted by posterior distribution.

---

The equation represents the **predictive distribution** for a new observation $y_{\text{new}}$ given a new input $x_{\text{new}}$ and the data $D$.

It combines:

1. **Likelihood** $p(y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, w)$: This term describes how likely the new output $y_{\text{new}}$ is for a given set of model weights $w$ and the new input $x_{\text{new}}$.
   
2. **Posterior** $p(w \mid D)$: This is the distribution of the model weights $w$ after observing the data $D$, representing the uncertainty in the weights.


The integral averages the likelihood of the new observation over all possible values of the model parameters $w$, weighted by the posterior distribution $p(w \mid D)$, because we don't know the exact value of $w$ — it can vary based on the data $D$.

Here’s why this happens:

1. **Uncertainty in the weights**: In Bayesian regression, we have uncertainty about the model parameters (weights) $w$, and the posterior distribution $p(w \mid D)$ reflects our belief about the possible values of $w$, given the observed data $D$.

2. **Prediction is uncertain**: For a new input $x_{\text{new}}$, the prediction $y_{\text{new}}$ depends on the model parameters $w$, and since we have uncertainty in $w$, we can't give a single prediction. Instead, we need to compute the distribution over all possible values of $y_{\text{new}}$ corresponding to all possible values of $w$.

3. **Integrating over the posterior**: The integral averages over all possible values of $w$ because we want to account for the uncertainty in $w$, which is captured by the posterior distribution $p(w \mid D)$. Each value of $w$ contributes to the prediction $y_{\text{new}}$ according to its likelihood, and the posterior distribution tells us how probable each $w$ is. By integrating, we are essentially weighing each possible prediction by how likely the corresponding weight $w$ is under the posterior distribution.

Thus, the integral provides the **expected prediction** by combining the likelihood of the new data with the uncertainty about the model parameters. This results in a distribution for the prediction, reflecting both the model's uncertainty and the uncertainty in the new data.

---

Since both the likelihood and posterior are Gaussian, the predictive distribution is also Gaussian:

$$
y_{\text{new}} \mid x_{\text{new}}, D \sim \mathcal{N} (\eta_{\text{new}}, \sigma_{\text{new}}^2)
$$

where:

$$
\eta_{\text{new}} = \mu_P^T x_{\text{new}}
$$

$$
\sigma_{\text{new}}^2 = x_{\text{new}}^T \Sigma_P x_{\text{new}} + \sigma^2
$$

The predictive variance $\sigma_{\text{new}}^2$ consists of two terms:  

1. $x_{\text{new}}^T \Sigma_P x_{\text{new}}$ – **Uncertainty due to finite data**, representing how much we should trust our estimate of $w$ (or simply uncertainty from the variance of $w$).
2. $\sigma^2$ – **Inherent observation noise**, representing the irreducible error in predicting $y$.

This decomposition highlights how **Bayesian regression naturally incorporates uncertainty in predictions**.

### **Why Bayesian Regression is Powerful**  

One major advantage of Bayesian regression over traditional point estimation methods is that it **provides uncertainty estimates**. So, With predictive distributions, we can give mean prediction with error bands.
![Guassian_Regression-5](/img/Guassian_Regression-5.png)
This is particularly useful in applications where knowing **confidence intervals** is crucial, such as:  
- **Medical diagnostics**, where uncertainty in predictions affects decision-making.  
- **Financial modeling**, where risk estimation is key.  
- **Autonomous systems**, where knowing when to be uncertain improves safety.

### **Conclusion**  

In this post, we derived the **posterior distribution** for Gaussian regression, connected **MAP estimation to ridge regression**, and explored the **predictive posterior distribution**, which quantifies uncertainty.  

Bayesian regression provides a **principled way** to incorporate prior beliefs and quantify uncertainty, making it an essential tool in machine learning.  

Next, we’ll take a brief pause from probabilistic machine learning methods, as we've covered the essentials thoroughly, and shift our focus to a new topic: **Multiclass Classification**. Stay tuned, and keep learning and growing!🚀
