Here is the link to the paper - [Efficient Algorithms for Online Decision Problems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2005-Efficient_Algorithms_for_Online_Decision_Problems.pdf). I highly recommend reading through the entire paper once or twice before continuing with this blog.

## **1. Introduction**

This paper explores **online decision problems**, where decisions must be made sequentially without knowing future costs. The goal is to ensure that the total cost incurred is **close to the best fixed decision in hindsight**.

### **Key Contributions:**

- Introducing **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)**, a computationally efficient alternative to **exponential weighting** methods like Weighted Majority.
- Extending FPL to **structured problems** (e.g., **shortest paths**, **tree-based search**, **adaptive Huffman coding**).
- Demonstrating that FPL achieves **low regret** while remaining computationally efficient.
- Showing how FPL can be applied **even when exact offline solutions are infeasible**, by leveraging approximation algorithms.


### **2. Online Decision Problem Setup**

**Problem Definition**

- At each time step $t$, a **cost vector** $s_t$ is revealed.
- The algorithm picks a **decision $d_t$** from a set $D$.
- The objective is to minimize the cumulative cost:
  $$
  \sum_{t=1}^{T} d_t \cdot s_t
  $$
  compared to the **best single decision in hindsight**:

  $$
  \min_{d \in D} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t.
  $$

**Example: The Experts Problem**

- Suppose there are **$n$ experts** providing recommendations.
- Each expert incurs a cost at each time step.
- The goal is to perform **as well as the best expert**.

Traditional solutions use **exponential weighting** but are computationally expensive. **FPL** provides a **simpler and faster** alternative.


### **3. Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) Algorithm**
**Key Idea**

- Instead of following the exact best decision so far (**Follow the Leader, FTL**), which can lead to excessive switching, we introduce **random perturbations**.
- This smooths decision-making and prevents adversarial manipulation.

**Algorithm**

1. Compute cumulative costs for each decision:
   $$
   c_t(e) = \sum_{\tau=1}^{t} s_\tau(e)
   $$
2. Add **random perturbation** $p_t(e)$ drawn from an exponential distribution:
   $$
   \tilde{c}_t(e) = c_t(e) + p_t(e).
   $$
3. Choose the decision **with the lowest perturbed cost**.

**Why Does This Work?**

- Reduces **frequent switching** of decisions.
- Makes the algorithm **less predictable** to adversarial environments.
- Maintains a **low regret bound**.


### **4. Regret Analysis of FPL**

The regret measures how much worse FPL is compared to the **best decision in hindsight**.

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] - \min_{d \in D} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t.
$$

**Step 1: The "Be the Leader" Algorithm**

- The **hypothetical** "Be the Leader" algorithm always picks the best decision so far:
  $$
  d_t = M(s_{1:t})
  $$
- It incurs **zero regret**:
  $$
  \sum_{t=1}^{T} M(s_{1:t}) \cdot s_t \leq M(s_{1:T}) \cdot s_{1:T}.
  $$
- However, it **switches too often**.

**Step 2: Introducing Perturbations**

FPL **adds perturbations** to cumulative costs before selecting the leader:
$$
M(s_{1:t-1} + p_t).
$$
The regret bound becomes:

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] \leq \min_{\text{fixed decision } d} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t + \eta R A T + D / \eta.
$$

**Step 3: Choosing the Optimal Perturbation Scale**

To balance stability and adaptation, we set:
$$
\eta = \sqrt{\frac{D}{RAT}}.
$$
This leads to the **final regret bound**:
$$
O(\sqrt{T}).
$$
This ensures **sublinear regret**, meaning FPL performs nearly as well as the best expert over time.


### **5. Applying FPL to Structured Problems**

FPL can be extended to **problems beyond expert selection**, such as **shortest paths**.

**Online Shortest Paths Problem**

- Given a **graph** with edge costs changing over time.
- Each round, the algorithm must select a **path from source $s$ to destination $t$**.
- The naive approach (treating paths as independent experts) is **computationally infeasible**.

**Efficient Approach: FPL at the Edge Level**

1. Instead of applying FPL to entire paths, apply **perturbations at the edge level**.
2. Compute **perturbed edge costs**:
   $$
   \tilde{c}_t(e) = c_t(e) + p_t(e).
   $$
3. **Compute the shortest path** based on these perturbed edge costs.
4. Select the **shortest path**.

**Why Does This Work?**

- **Avoids exponential complexity** by working at the edge level.
- **Efficiently computed** using shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s).
- **Regret bound remains low**:
  $$
  (1 + \epsilon) \times (\text{Best Path Cost}) + O(m n \log n).
  $$

**Other Structured Problems**

FPL has also been applied to:
- **Tree search**: Efficiently updating search trees.
- **Adaptive Huffman coding**: Dynamically optimizing prefix codes.
- **Online approximation algorithms**: Extending FPL when exact offline solutions are infeasible.


### **6. Summary**

- FPL is a simple, efficient alternative to exponential weighting methods. 
- It achieves regret $O(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring performance close to the best decision in hindsight. 
- The perturbation method generalizes to structured problems like shortest paths.
- FPL is computationally feasible even when the number of decisions is large.

## **Understanding the Additive Analysis and Regret Bounds**

The **Additive Analysis** section in the paper derives a regret bound for the **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)** algorithm. The key goal is to compare the **cumulative cost of FPL** to the **best fixed decision in hindsight**.


### **Key Notation**
Before deriving the regret bound, let's clarify the notation:

- $s_t$: **State (cost vector) at time $t$**  
  - At each time step, we observe a cost vector $s_t$, where each component represents the cost of a different decision.
  
- $d_t$: **Decision made at time $t$**  
  - The action chosen by the algorithm at time $t$.
  
- $M(x)$: **Best fixed decision in hindsight**  
  - Given a total cost vector $x$, $M(x)$ returns the best decision:
    $$
    M(x) = \arg\min_{d \in D} d \cdot x
    $$

- $s_{1:T}$: **Total cost vector over all $T$ time steps**  
  - This is simply the sum of all cost vectors:
    $$
    s_{1:T} = s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_T
    $$

- $p_t$: **Random perturbation added at time $t$**  
  - Introduced to smooth out decision-making and prevent frequent switches.

### **Goal: Regret Minimization**
We define regret as the difference between FPL’s total cost and the best fixed decision in hindsight:

$$
E \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} d_t \cdot s_t \right] - \min_{d \in D} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t.
$$


**Step 1: The Hypothetical "Be the Leader" Algorithm**

To analyze FPL, we first consider a **hypothetical "Be the Leader" algorithm**, which always picks the **best decision so far**:

$$
d_t = M(s_{1:t}).
$$

The key property of this algorithm is:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} M(s_{1:t}) \cdot s_t \leq M(s_{1:T}) \cdot s_{1:T}.
$$

**Why Does This Hold?**
- The **best decision in hindsight** is optimal for the full sequence.
- If we could always "be the leader," we would incur **zero regret**.
- However, this algorithm **switches too frequently**, making it unstable.


**Step 2: Introducing Perturbations**

FPL smooths out decision-making by adding **random perturbations** before selecting the leader:

$$
M(s_{1:t-1} + p_t).
$$

The analysis shows:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} M(s_{1:t} + p_t) \cdot s_t \leq M(s_{1:T}) \cdot s_{1:T} + D \sum_{t=1}^{T} |p_t - p_{t-1}|_\infty.
$$

**Key Insight**
- The first term on the RHS is the cost of the **best decision in hindsight**.
- The second term represents the **additional cost due to perturbations**.
- This term grows at most as $O(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring that regret remains **sublinear**.


**Step 3: Bounding the Impact of Perturbations**

The final step is to bound the effect of perturbations:

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] \leq \min_{\text{fixed decision } d} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t + \eta R A T + D / \eta.
$$

where:
- $\eta$ is a tuning parameter controlling the size of perturbations.
- $R, A, D$ are problem-dependent constants.

**Choosing the Optimal $\eta$**

To minimize regret, we set:

$$
\eta = \sqrt{\frac{D}{RAT}}.
$$

Plugging this into the regret bound:

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] \leq \min_{\text{fixed decision } d} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t + 2 \sqrt{DRAT}.
$$

**Final Regret Bound**
$$
O(\sqrt{T}).
$$

This ensures **sublinear regret**, meaning that over time, **FPL performs nearly as well as the best fixed decision**.


**Key Takeaways**
1. "Be the Leader" is optimal but switches too often.
2. FPL adds perturbations to smooth decision-making.
3. The regret bound is controlled by the trade-off between making stable choices and avoiding excessive randomness.
4. Choosing $\eta$ optimally gives a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring long-term efficiency.

## **Understanding the Key Notation and "Be the Leader" Algorithm**

This section provides a clear explanation of the **Key Notation** and the **"Be the Leader" algorithm** used in the **Additive Analysis** of the paper.


### **1. Key Notation (Clarified)**
To understand the regret bound derivation, let's first clarify the key mathematical symbols.

### **Online Decision Problem Setup**
In an **online decision problem**, we repeatedly make decisions without knowing future costs. Our goal is to minimize **total cost** over time.

---

| Symbol | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| $s_t$ | **State (cost vector) at time $t$**, representing the cost of each decision at step $t$. |
| $d_t$ | **Decision chosen at time $t$** (e.g., selecting an expert or a path). |
| $M(x)$ | **Best fixed decision in hindsight**, meaning the best decision if we knew all costs in advance. |
| $s_{1:T}$ | **Total cost vector over $T$ rounds**, defined as $s_{1:T} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} s_t$. |
| $p_t$ | **Random perturbation added at time $t$** to smooth decision-making. |

---

### **Example: Experts Problem**
- Suppose we are choosing between **two experts** (A and B).
- Each expert has a different cost at each time step.
- We want to **pick the expert that minimizes the total cost over time**.

---

| Time $t$ | Expert A's Cost $s_t(A)$ | Expert B's Cost $s_t(B)$ |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $t = 1$ | 0.3             | 0.4             |
| $t = 2$ | 0.5             | 0.2             |
| $t = 3$ | 0.4             | 0.5             |
| $t = 4$ | 0.2             | 0.3             |

---

- **Without perturbations**, we would always select the expert with the lowest cumulative cost.
- However, **this can cause excessive switching**, which leads to instability.


**2. Step 1: The "Be the Leader" Algorithm**

The **"Be the Leader" algorithm** is a **hypothetical strategy** where we always choose the **best decision so far**.

**How It Works**

At time $t$, select:

$$
d_t = M(s_{1:t}),
$$

meaning:
- Choose the **decision that has had the lowest total cost so far**.
- This ensures **no regret** because we are always picking the best option up to that point.

**Key Property**

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} M(s_{1:t}) \cdot s_t \leq M(s_{1:T}) \cdot s_{1:T}.
$$

**Why is this true?**

1. The **best decision in hindsight** is optimal for the full sequence.
2. If we could always "be the leader," we would incur **zero regret**.
3. However, this algorithm **switches decisions too frequently**, making it unstable.

**Example Calculation**

---

| Time $t$ | Cumulative Cost $A$ | Cumulative Cost $B$ | Chosen Expert |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| $t = 1$ | 0.3             | 0.4             | **A** |
| $t = 2$ | 0.8             | 0.6             | **B** |
| $t = 3$ | 1.2             | 1.1             | **B** |
| $t = 4$ | 1.4             | 1.4             | **Switching rapidly!** |

---

- The leader **switches frequently** whenever cumulative costs change slightly.
- This is problematic, especially in **adversarial settings**, because an adversary can force unnecessary switches.


**3. Why Do We Need Perturbations?**

The **"Be the Leader"** algorithm **switches too often**, making it inefficient.

**Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) Fixes This**

To avoid excessive switching, **FPL adds random perturbations** before selecting the leader:

$$
M(s_{1:t-1} + p_t).
$$

This **smooths out decision-making**:
- **Prevents rapid switches** caused by small cost changes.
- **Balances stability and adaptability**.
- **Maintains a low regret bound**.

**Key Insight**

- **FPL ensures that decisions do not fluctuate excessively**.
- **Adding perturbations leads to a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring long-term efficiency**.


---

### **Understanding Step 2 and Step 3 in Additive Analysis**

In the **Additive Analysis** section, Steps 2 and 3 are crucial for deriving the regret bound for **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)**. These steps show how perturbations help smooth decision-making while maintaining low regret.

---

**Step 2: Introducing Perturbations**

The issue with the **"Be the Leader"** algorithm is that it **switches too frequently**, leading to instability. To fix this, **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)** **adds small random perturbations** to past costs before selecting the leader:

$$
d_t = M(s_{1:t-1} + p_t).
$$

**Effect of Perturbations**

Instead of choosing the decision with the exact lowest cumulative cost, FPL selects the decision **with the lowest perturbed cost**:

$$
\tilde{c}_t(e) = c_t(e) + p_t(e).
$$

This ensures:
1. **Fewer unnecessary switches**: Small cost fluctuations no longer cause frequent decision changes.
2. **Better robustness against adversarial cost sequences**.

**Key Inequality**

The analysis shows:

$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} M(s_{1:t} + p_t) \cdot s_t \leq M(s_{1:T}) \cdot s_{1:T} + D \sum_{t=1}^{T} |p_t - p_{t-1}|_\infty.
$$

**Breaking It Down**

- **LHS**: The total cost incurred by FPL.
- **RHS**: The total cost of the best decision in hindsight **plus an extra term due to perturbations**.
- **The second term** captures the additional cost introduced by randomness.

Since perturbations are drawn from a well-chosen distribution, their effect remains **small** (bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$).


**Step 3: Bounding the Impact of Perturbations**

The final step is to **quantify how much extra cost perturbations introduce**.

The key regret bound derived is:

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] \leq \min_{\text{fixed decision } d} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t + \eta R A T + D / \eta.
$$

where:
- $\eta$ controls **how large the perturbations are**.
- $R, A, D$ are constants depending on the problem setup.

**Choosing the Optimal Perturbation Scale**

To balance stability and adaptation, they choose:

$$
\eta = \sqrt{\frac{D}{RAT}}.
$$

Plugging this into the regret bound:

$$
E[\text{Cost of FPL}] \leq \min_{\text{fixed decision } d} \sum_{t=1}^{T} d \cdot s_t + 2 \sqrt{DRAT}.
$$

**Final Regret Bound**
$$
O(\sqrt{T}).
$$

This means that **the regret grows sublinearly**, ensuring that over time, **FPL performs nearly as well as the best fixed decision**.


---

### **Understanding FPL with a Worked-Out Example**

To better understand **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)**, let's go through a **step-by-step numerical example**.


**Problem Setup**

- We have **two experts**: **A** and **B**.
- Each expert incurs a cost at each time step.
- We must **pick one expert per round** without knowing future costs.
- Our goal is to minimize **total cost over $T = 4$ rounds**.

**Cost Sequence**

---

| Time $t$ | Expert A's Cost $s_t(A)$ | Expert B's Cost $s_t(B)$ |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| $t = 1$ | 0.3             | 0.4             |
| $t = 2$ | 0.5             | 0.2             |
| $t = 3$ | 0.4             | 0.5             |
| $t = 4$ | 0.2             | 0.3             |

---

- **Without perturbations**, FPL would always pick the expert with the lowest cumulative cost.
- However, this leads to **frequent switching**.

**Step 1: Follow the Leader (FTL) - No Perturbation**

If we naively follow the leader **without perturbations**, we get:

| Time $t$ | Cumulative Cost $A$ | Cumulative Cost $B$ | Chosen Expert |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| $t = 1$ | 0.3             | 0.4             | **A** |
| $t = 2$ | 0.8             | 0.6             | **B** |
| $t = 3$ | 1.2             | 1.1             | **B** |
| $t = 4$ | 1.4             | 1.4             | **Switching rapidly!** |

**Problem with FTL**

- The algorithm **switches too frequently**, making it unstable.
- Small cost differences cause unnecessary **leader changes**.
- This is **bad in adversarial settings**, where cost sequences can be manipulated.

**Step 2: Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) - Adding Perturbations**

Now, let's **add perturbations**.

- We **randomly sample perturbations** $p_t(A)$ and $p_t(B)$ from an **exponential distribution**.
- Suppose we get:
  $$
  p_1(A) = 0.1, \quad p_1(B) = 0.2
  $$

**Step 2.1: Compute Perturbed Costs**

---

| Time $t$ | Cumulative Cost $A$ | Cumulative Cost $B$ | Perturbed $A$ | Perturbed $B$ | Chosen Expert |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| $t = 1$ | 0.3             | 0.4             | **0.4**       | **0.6**       | **A** |
| $t = 2$ | 0.8             | 0.6             | **0.9**       | **0.8**       | **B** |
| $t = 3$ | 1.2             | 1.1             | **1.3**       | **1.2**       | **B** |
| $t = 4$ | 1.4             | 1.4             | **1.5**       | **1.6**       | **A** |

---

**Step 2.2: What Changed?**

- **FPL smooths out decisions**: The perturbations prevent unnecessary switching.
- **Perturbations reduce instability**: Instead of switching too frequently (like FTL), FPL **stabilizes**.
- **Better stability → Lower regret!**  

**Step 3: Computing the Regret**

**Step 3.1: Compute Cost of FPL**

The total cost incurred by **FPL**:
$$
\sum_{t=1}^{T} \text{Chosen Expert's Cost}
$$
Using the decisions above:

$$
\text{Total Cost of FPL} = 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 1.2.
$$

**Step 3.2: Compute Cost of Best Expert in Hindsight**

If we had **perfect hindsight**, we would choose the best expert who had the **lowest total cost over all $T$ rounds**.

$$
\text{Total Cost of Best Expert} = \min(1.4, 1.4) = 1.4.
$$

**Step 3.3: Compute Regret**

Regret is the difference between FPL and the best fixed decision:

$$
\text{Regret} = E[\text{Cost of FPL}] - \text{Cost of Best Expert}.
$$

Since FPL **performs better than the best single expert**, it actually has **negative regret in this case!** In general, the regret is **bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$, ensuring FPL converges to the best decision in hindsight over time.**

---

### **Extending FPL to Structured Problems: Online Shortest Paths**  

One of the major contributions of the paper is extending **Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL)** beyond the **experts setting** to more **structured problems**, such as **online shortest paths**. This is important because treating every possible path as an independent expert is computationally infeasible when the number of paths is exponential in the number of edges.


**1. The Online Shortest Path Problem**

**Problem Setup**

- Given a **directed graph** with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.
- Each edge $e$ has a time cost $c_t(e)$ at each time step $t$.
- The goal is to **select a path from source $s$ to destination $t$** at each time step without knowing future costs.
- After selecting a path, we observe the costs of all edges.

**Objective**

We want to ensure that the total travel time over $T$ rounds is close to the best **single** path in hindsight.

**Challenges**

- The number of possible paths grows exponentially with the number of nodes, making **treating paths as experts infeasible**.
- Instead of treating whole paths as independent decisions, we need a way to **apply FPL efficiently at the edge level**.

**2. Applying FPL to Online Shortest Paths**

**Naïve Approach (Infeasible)**

- If we were to apply **vanilla FPL** directly, we would:
  1. Treat each **entire path** as an "expert."
  2. Maintain cumulative travel time for every path.
  3. Apply perturbations to total path costs.
  4. Choose the best path.

- **Problem:** The number of paths grows exponentially, making this computationally **infeasible**.

**Efficient Approach: FPL at the Edge Level**

To make FPL work efficiently, we **apply perturbations to edges instead of whole paths**:

**Follow the Perturbed Leading Path (FPL for Paths)**

**At each time step $t$:**

1. **For each edge $e$**, draw a random perturbation $p_t(e)$ from an exponential distribution.
2. Compute **perturbed edge costs**:
   $$
   \tilde{c}_t(e) = c_t(e) + p_t(e)
   $$
3. **Find the shortest path** using these perturbed edge costs.
4. Choose the **shortest path** in the graph based on the perturbed edge weights.

**Why Does This Work?**

- Since perturbations are applied **at the edge level**, we avoid maintaining explicit costs for all paths.
- The standard **shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s)** can efficiently compute the best path at each step.
- Theoretical guarantees remain valid: The expected regret is at most:
  
  $$
  (1 + \epsilon) \times (\text{Best Path Cost}) + O(m n \log n)
  $$

  where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of nodes.

**3. Understanding the Regret Bound**

We now derive the **regret bound** for online shortest paths.

**Key Definitions**

- Let $P_t$ be the path chosen by FPL at time $t$.
- Let $P^*$ be the best fixed path in hindsight, i.e., the path with the lowest total cost over $T$ rounds:
  
  $$
  P^* = \arg\min_{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} c_t(P).
  $$
- The regret of FPL is:
  
  $$
  \sum_{t=1}^{T} c_t(P_t) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} c_t(P^*).
  $$

**Applying FPL Analysis**

- The perturbation ensures that **bad paths are not chosen too often** and **good paths are discovered quickly**.
- The additional regret due to perturbation grows as $O(m n \log n)$, meaning it is still **sublinear in $T$**.

Thus, FPL guarantees:

$$
E[\text{Total Cost of FPL}] \leq (1 + \epsilon) \times \text{Best Path Cost} + O(m n \log n).
$$

**4. Why is This Important?**

**1. Generalization to Graph-Structured Problems**  

- This method can be applied to **any structured problem where the decision space is large**.
- Example: Instead of treating each full **decision tree** as an expert, perturbations can be applied at **the node level**.

**2. Computational Efficiency**  

- Unlike **exponential weighting algorithms** (which require maintaining weights for each path), this approach **only requires standard shortest-path computations**.
- **Time complexity:** Runs in **$O(m)$** (if using Bellman-Ford) or **$O(m + n \log n)$** (if using Dijkstra’s).

**3. Practical Use Cases**

- **Network Routing:** Selecting optimal paths in a **dynamic network**.
- **Robot Navigation:** Choosing paths in a changing environment.
- **Traffic Prediction:** Adjusting routes based on real-time conditions.

**5. Summary**

**Problem**: Online shortest path selection where edge costs change over time.  
**FPL Extension**: Instead of treating full paths as experts, **apply perturbations to edges**.  
**Algorithm**:  
   1. Add **random noise** to **edge costs**.  
   2. Compute the **shortest path** with the perturbed costs.  
   3. Follow that path.  
**Regret Bound**:  
   - **Competitive with the best fixed path** in hindsight.
   - **Extra cost** due to perturbations is **small** (only $O(m n \log n)$).  
**Key Benefit**: **Works efficiently** even when the number of paths is exponential.
